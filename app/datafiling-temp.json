          "text": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Anti-Injunction Act imposes a \"pay first, litigate later\" rule that is central to Federal tax assessment and collection. The Act applies to essentially every tax penalty in the Internal Revenue Code. There is no reason to think that Congress made a special exception for the penalty imposed by section 5000A. On the contrary, there are three reasons to conclude that the Anti-Injunction Act applies here. First, Congress directed that the section 5000A penalty shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes. Second, Congress provided that penalties are included in taxes for assessment purposes. And, third, the section 5000A penalty bears the key indicia of a tax. Congress directed that the section 5000A penalty shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes. That directive triggers the Anti-Injunction Act, which provides that \"no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax may be maintained in any court by any person.\"",

There are three main differences. First, when the Anti-Injunction Act applies, you have to pay the tax or the penalty first and then litigate later to get it back with interest. Second, you have to exhaust administrative remedies. Even after you pay the tax, you can't immediately go to court. You have to go to the Secretary and give the Secretary at least 6 months to see if the matter can be resolved administratively. And, third, even in the very carefully defined situations in which Congress has permitted a challenge to a tax or a penalty before it's paid, the Secretary has to make the first move. The taxpayer is never allowed to rush into court before the tax -- before the Secretary sends a notice of deficiency to start the process. Now, if -- if the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply here, none of those rules apply. And that's not just for this case; it will be for every challenge to a section 5000A penalty going forward. The taxpayer will be able to go to court at any time without exhausting administrative remedies; there will be none of the limitations that apply in terms of you have to wait for the Secretary to make the -足",

The refund statute this Court held in Dolan was jurisdictional, and the Court in both Dolan and Brockamp held that the statute of limitations that applies to the refund statute cases is jurisdictional.

And it may seem from where we stand now that that authority is or could be very, very tightly cabined, but if -- if this Court were to conclude that it isn't jurisdictional, that does empower courts to find other circumstances in which they might find it equitable to allow cases to go forward in the absence of -- despite the existence of the Anti-Injunction Act. And, second, although I certainly am not going to stand up here and disparage the attorneys from the United States in the slightest, the reality is that if this isn't jurisdictional, then it's -- the argument -- it's open to the argument that it's subject to forfeiture by a simple omission in failing to raise it in an answer.

And the -- we have made a representation, and it was a carefully made representation, in our brief that it is the interpretation of the agencies charged with interpreting this statute, the Treasury Department and the Department of Health and Human Services, that there is no other consequence apart from the tax penalty. And I do think, if I could talk for a couple of minutes about the argument that was discussed as to whether this can be conceived of as a suit just challenging the requirement, which is entirely stand-alone based on inferences drawn from the exemptions. I really don't think that's right. And if I could spend a minute on it, I think it's important. The exemptions in section 5000A, it is true that there are two categories of exemptions. There are exemptions to the penalty and exemptions to the subsection (a) requirement. But the -- but I think, not only as a practical matter, but I think there's a textual indication and even as a legal matter, they are -- they both function as exceptions to the requirement. First, as a practical matter, one of those exemptions is a hardship exemption. And if the Court will just bear with me for one minute here, it's at page 11A of the appendix to our brief. It provides that a person can go to the Secretary of HHS and obtain a hardship exemption for -- which would, as a formal matter here, excuse compliance with the penalty. It seems to me to make very little sense to say that someone who has gone to an official of the United States and obtained an exemption would, nonetheless, be in a position of being a law breaker. We think another way in which you can get to the same conclusion slightly differently is by considering the provision on the prior page, 10A, which is 5000A -- 5000A(e)(3), members of Indian tribes. Members of Indian tribes are exempt only from the penalty as a formal matter under the structure of the statute here; but, the reason for that is because members of Indian tribes obtain their healthcare through the Indian Health Service, which is a clinic-based system that doesn't involve insurance at all. It's an entirely different system. They were taken out of this statute because they get their healthcare through a different system. And it doesn't make any sense to think that persons getting their health care through the Indian Health Service are violating the law because -- exempt only from the penalty, but still under a legal obligation to have insurance, when the whole point of this is that they're supposed to be in a clinic-based system.",

This is a provision that provides for a certification that certain individuals can get. And it's the paragraph starting with the words \"other provisions,\" contains the quote. And it says, an individual with a certification that the individual is exempt from the requirement under section 5000A, by reason of section 5000A(e)(1) of such code, is entitled to a certificate that allows for enrollment in a particular program for this category of people.

And let me give you an example of one category of person that might be -- the very poor, who are exempt from the penalty but subject to the mandate. Mr. Long says this must be a mandate exemption because it would be wholly harsh and unreasonable for Congress to expect people who are very poor to comply with the requirement to obtain health insurance when they have no means of doing so. That gets things exactly backwards. The very poor are the people Congress would be most concerned about with respect to the mandate to the extent one of the justifications for the mandate is to prevent emergency room cost shifting when people receive uncompensated care. So they would have had very good reason to make the very poor subject to the mandate, and then they didn't do it in a draconian way; they gave the very poor a means of complying with the insurance mandate, and that is through the Medicaid system.",

It's a classic pocketbook injury. But even if I'm wrong about that question, Justice Kagan, the question of who has standing to bring the challenge that we seek to bring seems to me very different -- your hypothetical plaintiff is very different from the actual plaintiffs. We have individuals who are planning for compliance in order to avoid a penalty, which is what their affidavits say. And we have the States, who will be subject no doubt to all sorts of adverse ramifications if they refuse to enroll in Medicaid the people who are forced into Medicaid by virtue of the mandate. So we don't have the problem of no adverse consequences in the case. And then, we have the separate distinction between the question of who has Article III standing in order to maintain a suit and the question of who is subject to a legal obligation. And you've said in your cases that even if there may be no one who has standing to challenge a legal obligation like the incompatibility clause or something, that doesn't somehow convert the legal obligation into a legal nullity. Finally, with respect to the States, even if we are wrong about everything I've said so far, the States clearly fall within the exception recognized in South Carolina against Regan. They are injured by the mandate because the mandate forces 6 million new people onto their Medicaid rolls. But they are not directly subject to the mandate, nor could they violate the mandate and incur a penalty.",

And the parties' principal argument why that does not make the Anti-Injunction Act applicable is that, well, that simply goes to the Secretary's activities. And I would simply ask, if -- if you look at chapters 63 and 64 of the Internal Revenue Code, which are the chapters on assessment and collection, they are not just addressed to the Secretary. There are many provisions in there that are addressed to courts and indeed talk about this interaction, the very limited situations in which courts are permitted to restrain the assessment and collection of taxes. There was a statement made that there aren't -- and many of the exceptions to the Anti-Injunction Act are in the assessment and collection provisions -- there was a statement made that none of these directly confer jurisdiction to restrain the assessment and collection of taxes. That's not true. In footnote 11 of our opening brief, we cite several. I'll simply mention section 6213 as an example. That says -- I quote: \"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 7421(a), the making of such assessment or the beginning of such proceeding or levy during the time such prohibition is in force may be enjoined by a proceeding in the proper court, including the Tax Court. The Tax Court shall have no jurisdiction to enjoin any action or proceeding or order any refund under this subsection unless a timely petition for redetermination of the deficiency has been filed, and then only in respect of the deficiency that is the subject of such petition.\"",

The -- the over-arching thing in my mind is it's -- it's up to Congress, within leeway. And they did not use that word \"tax,\" and they did have a couple of exceptions. And it is true that all this language that you quote -- you know, the first two sentences and so forth, it talks about the use of tax in the IRC. It talks about the penalties and liabilities provided by this subchapter. And we look over here and it's a penalty and liability provided by a different law, which says collect it through the subchapter, and it has nothing to do with the IRC. See? So we've got it in a separate place, we can see pretty clearly what they're trying to do. They couldn't really care very much about interfering with collecting this one. That's all the statutory argument. Are you following me? You see? I'm trying to get you to focus on that kind of argument.",

The -- the refund statute that does specifically refer to penalties, that has nothing to do with this argument that it's assessed and collected in the same manner as a tax. That would simply go to the point that well, you can't just call it a tax, because they've referred to it as a penalty. And finally, on jurisdiction, you know, I think the key point is we have a long line of this Court's decisions that's really been ratified by Congress, with all these exceptions in jurisdictional terms. As I read Bowles and John R. Sand & Gravel, the -- the gist of those decisions was not any special sort of rule about appeals, it's that when we have that situation, which I would submit applies as much to the collection of Federal taxes as it does to appeals from Federal district courts when we have this degree of -足 of precedent, including precedent from Congress in the form of amendments to this Anti-Injunction Act, that should be -- the presumption should be that this is jurisdictional.
