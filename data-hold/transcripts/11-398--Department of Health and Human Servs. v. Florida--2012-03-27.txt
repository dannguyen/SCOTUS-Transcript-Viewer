 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              Mr. Chief Justice, and

10   may it please the Court:

11                  The Affordable Care Act addresses a

12   fundamental and enduring problem in our health care

13   system and our economy.           Insurance has become the

14   predominant means of paying for health care in this

15   country.     Insurance has become the predominant means of

16   paying for health care in this country.

17                  For most Americans, for more than 80 percent

18   of Americans, the insurance system does provide

19   effective access.     Excuse me.              But for more than 40

20   million Americans who do not have access to health

21   insurance either through their employer or through

22   government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, the

23   system does not work.         Those individuals must resort to

24   the individual market, and that market does not provide

25   affordable health insurance.

                                         3

 1                It does not do so because, because the

 2   multibillion dollar subsidies that are available for

 3   the, the employer market are not available in the

 4   individual market.     It does not do so because ERISA and

 5   HIPAA regulations that preclude, that preclude

 6   discrimination against people based on their medical

 7   history do not apply in the individual market.               That is

 8   an economic problem.       And it begets another economic

 9   problem.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why aren't those problems

11   that the Federal Government can address directly?

12                GENERAL VERRILLI:              They can address it

13   directly, Justice Scalia, and they are addressing it

14   directly through this, through this Act by regulating

15   the means by which health care, by which health care is

16   purchased.   That is the way this Act works.

17                Under the Commerce Clause, what, what

18   Congress has done is to enact reforms of the insurance

19   market, directed at the individual insurance market,

20   that preclude, that preclude discrimination based on

21   pre-existing conditions, that require guaranteed issue

22   and community rating, and it uses -- and the minimum

23   coverage provision is necessary to carry into execution

24   those insurance reforms.

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Can you create commerce in

                                       4

 1   order to regulate it?

 2                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              That's not what's going

 3   on here, Justice Kennedy, and we are not seeking to

 4   defend the law on that basis.

 5                  In this case, the -- what is being regulated

 6   is the method of financing health, the purchase of

 7   health care.     That itself is economic activity with

 8   substantial effects on interstate commerce.                       And -­

 9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Any self purchasing?

10   Anything I -- you know if I'm in any market at all, my

11   failure to purchase something in that market subjects me

12   to regulation.

13                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              No.        That's not our

14   position at all, Justice Scalia.                    In the health care

15   market, the health care market is characterized by the

16   fact that aside from the few groups that Congress chose

17   to exempt from the minimum coverage requirement -- those

18   who for religious reasons don't participate, those who

19   are incarcerated, Indian tribes -- virtually everybody

20   else is either in that market or will be in that market,

21   and the distinguishing feature of that is that they

22   cannot, people cannot generally control when they enter

23   that market or what they need when they enter that

24   market.

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, the same, it

 1   seems to me, would be true say for the market in

 2   emergency services:      police, fire, ambulance, roadside

 3   assistance, whatever.       You don't know when you're going

 4   to need it; you're not sure that you will.                     But the same

 5   is true for health care.          You don't know if you're going

 6   to need a heart transplant or if you ever will.                     So

 7   there is a market there.          To -- in some extent, we all

 8   participate in it.

 9                So can the government require you to buy a

10   cell phone because that would facilitate responding when

11   you need emergency services?              You can just dial 911 no

12   matter where you are?

13                GENERAL VERRILLI:              No, Mr. Chief Justice.           I

14   think that's different.         It's -- We -- I don't think we

15   think of that as a market.             This is a market.          This is

16   market regulation.     And in addition, you have a

17   situation in this market not only where people enter

18   involuntarily as to when they enter and won't be able to

19   control what they need when they enter but when they -­

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    It seems to me

21   that's the same as in my hypothetical.                     You don't know

22   when you're going to need police assistance.                     You can't

23   predict the extent to emergency response that you'll

24   need.   But when you do, and the government provides it.

25   I thought that was an important part of your argument,

                                       6

 1   that when you need health care, the government will make

 2   sure you get it.   Well, when you need police assistance

 3   or fire assistance or ambulance assistance, the

 4   government is going to make sure to the best extent it

 5   can that you get it -- get it.

 6               GENERAL VERRILLI:                I think the fundamental

 7   difference, Mr. Chief Justice, is that that's not an

 8   issue of market regulation.              This is an issue of market

 9   regulation, and that's how Congress, that's how Congress

10   looked at this problem.          There is a market.        Insurance

11   is provided through the market system -­

12               JUSTICE ALITO:              Do you think there is a, a

13   market for burial services?

14               GENERAL VERRILLI:                For burial services?

15               JUSTICE ALITO:              Yes.

16               GENERAL VERRILLI:                Yes, Justice Alito, I

17   think there is.

18               JUSTICE ALITO:              All right, suppose that you

19   and I walked around downtown Washington at lunch hour

20   and we found a couple of healthy young people and we

21   stopped them and we said, "You know what you're doing?

22   You are financing your burial services right now because

23   eventually you're going to die, and somebody is going to

24   have to pay for it, and if you don't have burial

25   insurance and you haven't saved money for it, you're

                                        7

 1   going to shift the cost to somebody else."

 2                Isn't that a very artificial way of talking

 3   about what somebody is doing?

 4                GENERAL VERRILLI:                No, that -­

 5                JUSTICE ALITO:              And if that's true, why

 6   isn't it equally artificial to say that somebody who is

 7   doing absolutely nothing about health care is financing

 8   health care services?

 9                GENERAL VERRILLI:                It's, I think it's

10   completely different.         The -- and the reason is that

11   the, the burial example is not -- the difference is here

12   we are regulating the method by which you are paying for

13   something else -- health care -- and the insurance

14   requirement -- I think the key thing here is my friends

15   on the other side acknowledge that it is within the

16   authority of Congress under Article I under the commerce

17   power to impose guaranteed-issue and community rating

18   forms, to end -- to impose a minimum coverage provision.

19   Their argument is just that it has to occur at the point

20   of sale, and -­

21                JUSTICE ALITO:              I don't see the difference.

22   You can get burial insurance.                 You can get health

23   insurance.   Most people are going to need health care.

24   Almost everybody.     Everybody is going to be buried or

25   cremated at some point.           What's the difference?

 1                GENERAL VERRILLI:               Well, one big difference,

 2   one big difference, Justice Alito, is the -- you don't

 3   have the cost shifting to other market participants.

 4   Here -­

 5                JUSTICE ALITO:             Sure you do, because if you

 6   don't have money then the State is going to pay for it.

 7   Or some -­

 8                GENERAL VERRILLI:               That's different.

 9                JUSTICE ALITO:             Or a family member is going

10   to pay.

11                GENERAL VERRILLI:               That's a difference and

12   it's a significant difference.                 In this situation one of

13   the economic effects Congress is addressing is that

14   the -- there -- the many billions of dollars of

15   uncompensated costs are transferred directly to other

16   market participants.       It's transferred directly to other

17   market participants because health care providers charge

18   higher rates in order to cover the cost of uncompensated

19   care, and insurance companies reflect those higher rates

20   in higher premiums, which Congress found translates to a

21   thousand dollars per family in additional health

22   insurance costs.

23                JUSTICE ALITO:             But isn't that a very small

24   part of what the mandate is doing?                      You can correct me

25   if these figures are wrong, but it appears to me that

                                        9

 1   the CBO has estimated that the average premium for a

 2   single insurance policy in the non-group market would be

 3   roughly $5,800 in -- in 2016.

 4                Respondents -- the economists have

 5   supported -- the Respondents estimate that a young,

 6   healthy individual targeted by the mandate on average

 7   consumes about $854 in health services each year.                    So

 8   the mandate is forcing these people to provide a huge

 9   subsidy to the insurance companies for other purposes

10   that the act wishes to serve, but isn't -- if those

11   figures are right, isn't it the case that what this

12   mandate is really doing is not requiring the people who

13   are subject to it to pay for the services that they are

14   going to consume?     It is requiring them to subsidize

15   services that will be received by somebody else.

16                GENERAL VERRILLI:                No, I think that -- I do

17   think that's what the Respondents argue.                    It's just not

18   right.   I think it -- it really gets to a fundamental

19   problem with their argument.

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:                If you're going to have

21   insurance, that's how insurance works.

22                GENERAL VERRILLI:                A, it is how insurance

23   works, but, B, the problem that they -- that they are

24   identifying is not that problem.                    The -- the guaranteed

25   issue and community rating reforms do not have the

                                        10

 1   effect of forcing insurance companies to take on lots of

 2   additional people who they then can't afford to cover

 3   because they're -- they tend to be the sick, and that

 4   is -- in fact, the exact opposite is what happens here.

 5                The -- when -- when you enact Guaranteed

 6   Issue and Community Rating Reforms and you do so in the

 7   absence of a minimum coverage provision, it's not that

 8   insurance companies take on more and more people and

 9   then need a subsidy to cover it, it's that fewer and

10   fewer people end up with insurance because their rates

11   are not regulated.      Insurance companies, when -- when

12   they have to offer Guaranteed Issue and Community

13   Rating, they are entitled to make a profit.                They charge

14   rates sufficient to cover only the sick population

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Could you help -- help me

17   with this.   Assume for the moment -- you may disagree.

18   Assume for the moment that this is unprecedented, this

19   is a step beyond what our cases have allowed, the

20   affirmative duty to act to go into commerce.                If that is

21   so, do you not have a heavy burden of justification?

22                I understand that we must presume laws are

23   constitutional, but, even so, when you are changing the

24   relation of the individual to the government in this,

25   what we can stipulate is, I think, a unique way, do you

 1   not have a heavy burden of justification to show

 2   authorization under the Constitution?

 3               GENERAL VERRILLI:                So two things about that,

 4   Justice Kennedy.   First, we think this is regulation of

 5   people's participation in the health care market, and

 6   all -- all this minimum coverage provision does is say

 7   that, instead of requiring insurance at the point of

 8   sale, that Congress has the authority under the commerce

 9   power and the necessary proper power to ensure that

10   people have insurance in advance of the point of sale

11   because of the unique nature of this market, because

12   this is a market in which -- in which you -- although

13   most of the population is in the market most of the

14   time -- 83 percent visit a physician every year; 96

15   percent over a five-year period -- so virtually

16   everybody in society is in this market, and you've got

17   to pay for the health care you get, the predominant way

18   in which it's -- in which it's paid for is insurance,

19   and -- and the Respondents agree that Congress could

20   require that you have insurance in order to get health

21   care or forbid health care from being provided -­

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Why do you -- why do you

23   define the market that broadly?                  Health care.   It may

24   well be that everybody needs health care sooner or

 1   everybody needs a liver transplant.                      Why -­

 2                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              That's correct, Justice

 3   Scalia, but you never know whether you're going to be

 4   that person.

 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Could you define the

 6   market -- everybody has to buy food sooner or later, so

 7   you define the market as food, therefore, everybody is

 8   in the market; therefore, you can make people buy

 9   broccoli.

10                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              No, that's quite

11   different.     That's quite different.                   The food market,

12   while it shares that trait that everybody's in it, it is

13   not a market in which your participation is often

14   unpredictable and often involuntary.                      It is not a market

15   in which you often don't know before you go in what you

16   need, and it is not a market in which, if you go in

17   and -- and seek to obtain a product or service, you will

18   get it even if you can't pay for it.                      It doesn't -­

19                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is that a principal basis

20   for distinguishing this from other situations?                      I mean,

21   you know, you can also say, well, the person subject to

22   this has blue eyes.       That would indeed distinguish it

23   from other situations.          Is it a principle basis?              I

24   mean, it's -- it's a basis that explains why the

25   government is doing this, but is it -- is it a basis

                                        13

 1   which shows that this is not going beyond what -- what

 2   the -- the system of enumerated powers allows the

 3   government to do.

 4                 GENERAL VERRILLI:               Yes, for two reasons.

 5   First, this -- the test, as this Court has articulated

 6   it, is:   Is Congress regulating economic activity with a

 7   substantial effect on interstate commerce?

 8                 The way in which this statute satisfies the

 9   test is on the basis of the factors that I have

10   identified.    If -­

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Mr. Verrilli, I thought

12   that your main point is that, unlike food or any other

13   market, when you made the choice not to buy insurance,

14   even though you have every intent in the world to

15   self-insure, to save for it, when disaster strikes, you

16   may not have the money.           And the tangible result of it

17   is -- we were told there was one brief that Maryland

18   Hospital Care bills 7 percent more because of these

19   uncompensated costs, that families pay a thousand

20   dollars more than they would if there were no

21   uncompensated costs.

22                 I thought what was unique about this is it's

23   not my choice whether I want to buy a product to keep me

24   healthy, but the cost that I am forcing on other people

25   if I don't buy the product sooner rather than later.

                                        14

 1               GENERAL VERRILLI:              That is -- and that is

 2   definitely a difference that distinguishes this market

 3   and justifies this as a regulation.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.     So if that is

 5   your difference -- if that is your difference, I'm

 6   somewhat uncertain about your answers to -- for example,

 7   Justice Kennedy asked, can you, under the Commerce

 8   Clause, Congress create commerce where previously none

 9   existed.

10               Well, yeah, I thought the answer to that

11   was, since McCulloch versus Maryland, when the Court

12   said Congress could create the Bank of the United States

13   which did not previously exist, which job was to create

14   commerce that did not previously exist, since that time

15   the answer has been, yes.          I would have thought that

16   your answer -- can the government, in fact, require you

17   to buy cell phones or buy burials that, if we propose

18   comparable situations, if we have, for example, a

19   uniform United States system of paying for every burial

20   such as Medicare Burial, Medicaid Burial, CHIP Burial,

21   ERISA Burial and Emergency Burial beside the side of the

22   road, and Congress wanted to rationalize that system,

23   wouldn't the answer be, yes, of course, they could.

24               GENERAL VERRILLI:              So -­

25               JUSTICE BREYER:            And the same with the

                                     15

 1   computers or the same with the -- the cell phones, if

 2   you're driving by the side of the highway and there is a

 3   federal emergency service just as you say you have to

 4   buy certain mufflers for your car that don't hurt the

 5   environment, you could -- I mean, see, doesn't it depend

 6   on the situation?

 7                GENERAL VERRILLI:                It does, Justice Breyer,

 8   and if Congress were to enact laws like that, we -­

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:              We would be -- or -­

10                GENERAL VERRILLI:                My responsibility -- and

11   I would defend them on a rationale like that, but I do

12   think that we are advancing a narrower rationale.

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Well, then your question

14   is whether or not there are any limits on the Commerce

15   Clause.   Can you identify for us some limits on the

16   Commerce Clause?

17                GENERAL VERRILLI:                Yes.       The -- the

18   rationale purely under the Commerce Clause that we're

19   advocating here would not justify forced purchases of

20   commodities for the purpose of stimulating demand.                    We

21   -- the -- it would not justify purchases of insurance

22   for the purposes -- in situations in which insurance

23   doesn't serve as the method of payment for service -­

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:               But why not?        If

25   Congress -- if Congress says that the interstate

                                        16

 1   commerce is affected, isn't, according to your view,

 2   that the end of the analysis.

 3                GENERAL VERRILLI:               No.        The, the -- we think

 4   that in a -- when -- the difference between those

 5   situations and this situation is that in those

 6   situations, Your Honor, Congress would be moving to

 7   create commerce.   Here Congress is regulating existing

 8   commerce, economic activity that is already going on,

 9   people's participation in the health care market, and is

10   regulating to deal with existing effects of existing

11   commerce.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     That -- that it

13   seems to me, it's a -- it's a passage in your reply

14   brief that I didn't quite grasp.                   It's the same point.

15   You say health insurance is not purchased for its own

16   sake, like a car or broccoli; it is a means of financing

17   health care consumption and covering universal risks.

18   Well, a car or broccoli aren't purchased for their own

19   sake, either.   They are purchased for the sake of

20   transportation or in broccoli, covering the need for

21   food.   I -- I don't understand that distinction.

22                GENERAL VERRILLI:               The difference, Mr. Chief

23   Justice, is that health insurance is the means of

24   payment for health care and broccoli is -­

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Well, now that's a

 1   significant -- I'm sorry.

 2                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              And -- and broccoli is

 3   not the means of payment for anything else.                       And an

 4   automobile is not -­

 5                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    It's the means of

 6   satisfying a basic human need, just as your insurance is

 7   a means of satisfying -­

 8                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              But I do think that's the

 9   difference between existing commerce activity in the

10   market already occurring -- the people in the health

11   care market purchasing, obtaining health care

12   services -- and the creation of commerce.                       And the

13   principle that we are advocating here under the Commerce

14   Clause does not take the step of justifying the creation

15   of commerce.     It's a regulation of the existing

16   commerce.

17                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              General Verrilli, can we

18   - can we go back to, Justice Breyer asked a question,

19   and it kind of interrupted your answer to my question.

20   And tell me if I'm wrong about this, but I thought a

21   major, major point of your argument was that the people

22   who don't participate in this market are making it much

23   more expensive for the people who do; that is, they -­

24   they will get, a good number of them will get services

25   that they can't afford at the point where they need

                                        18

 1   them, and the result is that everybody else's premiums

 2   get raised.    So you're not -- it's not your -- your free

 3   choice just to do something for yourself.                      What you do

 4   is going to affect others, affect them in -- in a major

 5   way.

 6                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              That -- that absolutely

 7   is a justification for Congress's action here.                      That is

 8   existing economic activity that Congress is regulating

 9   by means of this rule.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            General Verrilli, you -­

11   you could say that about buying a car.                      If -- if people

12   don't buy cars, the price that those who do buy cars pay

13   will have to be higher.          So you could say in order to

14   bring the price down, you are hurting these other people

15   by not buying a car.

16                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              That is not what we are

17   saying, Justice Scalia.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's not -- that's not

19   what you're saying.

20                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              That's not -- not -­

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I thought it was.          I

22   thought you were saying other people are going to have

23   to pay more for insurance because you're not buying it.

24                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              No.        It's because you're

25   going -- in the health care market, you're going into

 2   getting the health care service anyway as a result of

 3   the social norms that allow -- that -- to which we've

 4   obligated ourselves so that people get health care.

 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, don't obligate

 6   yourself to that.     Why -- you know?

 7                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, I can't imagine

 8   that that -- that the Commerce Clause would --would

 9   forbid Congress from taking into account this deeply

10   embedded social norm.

16   regulates the method of paying for a service that the

22                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               General, I see or have

23   seen three strands of arguments in your briefs, and one

24   of them is echoed today.            The first strand that I have

25   seen is that Congress can pass any necessary laws to

                                        20

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   effect those powers within its rights, i.e., because it

 2   made a decision that to effect, to effect mandatory

 3   issuance of insurance, that it could also obligate the

 4   mandatory purchase of it.

 5               The second strand I see is self-insurance

 6   affects the market, and so the government can regulate

 7   those who self-insure.

 8               And the third argument -- and I see all of

 9   them as different -- is that what the government is

10   doing, and I think it's the argument you're making

11   today -- that what the -- what the government is saying

12   is if you pay for -- if you use health services, you

13   have to pay with insurance.            Because only insurance will

14   guarantee that whatever need for health care that you

15   have will be covered.      Because virtually no one, perhaps

16   with the exception of 1 percent of the population, can

17   afford the massive cost if the unexpected happens.

18               This third argument seems to be saying what

19   we are regulating is health care, and when you go for

20   health services, you have to pay for insurance, and

21   since insurance won't issue at the moment that you

22   consume the product, we can reasonably, necessarily tell

23   you to buy it ahead of time, because you can't buy it at

24   the moment that you need it.

25               Is that -- which of these three is your

                                     21

 1   argument?     Are all of them your argument?                     I'm just not

 2   sure what the -­

 3                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              So, let me try to state

 4   it this way.     The Congress enacted reforms of the

 5   insurance market, the guaranteed-issue and

 6   community-rating reforms.             It did so to deal with a very

 7   serious problem that results in 40 million people not

 8   being able to get insurance and therefore not access to

 9   the health care environment.                Everybody agrees in this

10   case that those are within Congress's Article I powers.

11                  The minimum coverage provision is necessary

12   to carry those provisions into -- into execution;

13   because without them, without those provisions, without

14   minimum coverage, guaranteed issue and community rating

15   will, as the experience in the States showed, make

16   matters worse, not better.               There will be fewer people

17   covered; it will cost more.               Now the -- so -­

18                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So on that ground,

19   you're answering affirmatively to my colleagues that

20   have asked you the question, can the government force

21   you into commerce.

22                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              So -- no.

23                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               And there is no limit to

24   that power.

25                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              No.        No.   Because that's

                                        22

 1   -- that's the first part of our argument.

 2                  The second part of our argument is that the

 3   means here that the Congress has chosen, the minimum

 4   coverage provision, is a means that regulates the -­

 5   that regulates economic activity, namely your

 6   transaction in the health care market, with substantial

 7   effects on interstate commerce; and it is the

 8   conjunction of those two that we think provides the

 9   particularly secure foundation for this statute under

10   the commerce power.

11                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            General, you've talked on -­

12   a couple of times about other alternatives that Congress

13   might have had, other alternatives that the Respondents

14   suggest to deal with this problem, in particular, the

15   alternative of mandating insurance at the point at which

16   somebody goes to a hospital or an emergency room and

17   asks for care.

18                  Did Congress consider those alternatives?

19   Why did it reject them?           How should we think about the

20   question of alternative ways of dealing with these

21   problems?

22                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              I do think, Justice

23   Kagan, that the point of difference between my friends

24   on the other side and the United States is about one of

25   timing.     They have agreed that Congress has Article I

                                        23

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   authority to impose an insurance requirement or other -­

 2   or other penalty at the point of sale, and they have

 3   agreed that Congress has the authority to do that to

 4   achieve the same objectives that the minimum coverage

 5   provision of the Affordable Care Act is designed to

 6   achieve.   This is a situation if which we are talking

 7   about means.     Congress gets a substantial deference in

 8   the choice of means, and if one thinks about the

 9   difference between the means they say Congress should

10   have chosen and the means Congress did choose, I think

11   you can see why it was eminently more sensible for

12   Congress to choose the means that it chose.

13                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I'm not sure which way it

14   cuts.   If the Congress has alternate means, let's assume

15   it can use the tax power to raise revenue and to just

16   have a national health service, single payer.                  How does

17   that factor into our analysis?                  In the one sense, it can

18   be argued that this is what the government is doing; it

19   ought to be honest about the power that it's using and

20   use the correct power.          On the other hand, it means that

21   since the Court can do it anyway -- Congress can do it

22   anyway, we give a certain amount of latitude.                  I'm not

23   sure which the way the argument goes.

24                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              Let me try to answer that

25   question, Justice Kennedy, and get back to the question

                                        24

 1   you asked me earlier.       The, the -- I do think one

 2   striking feature of the argument here that this is a

 3   novel exercise of power is that what Congress chose to

 4   do was to rely on market mechanisms and efficiency and a

 5   method that has more choice than would the traditional

 6   Medicare/Medicaid type model; and so it seems a little

 7   ironic to suggest that that counts against it.

 8               But beyond that, in the sense that it's

 9   novel, this provision is novel in the same way, or

10   unprecedented in the same way, that the Sherman Act was

11   unprecedented when the Court upheld it in the Northern

12   Securities case; or the Packers and Stockyards Act was

13   unprecedented when the Court upheld it, or the National

14   Labor Relations Act was unprecedented when the Court

15   upheld it in Jones and Laughlin; or the -- the dairy

16   price supports in Wrightwood Dairy and Rock Royal -­

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Oh, no, it's not.           They all

18   involved commerce.     There was no doubt that was what

19   regulated was commerce.         And here you're regulating

20   somebody who isn't covered.

21               By the way, I don't agree with you that the

22   relevant market here is health care.                  You're not

23   regulating health care.         You're regulating insurance.

24   It's the insurance market that you're addressing and

25   you're saying that some people who are not in it must be

                                     25

 1   in it and that's -- that's difference from regulating in

 2   any manner commerce that already exists out there.

 3                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, to the extent that

 4   we are looking at the comprehensive scheme, Justice

 5   Scalia, it is regulating commerce that already exists

 6   out there.     And the means in which that regulation is

 7   made effective here, the minimum coverage provision, is

 8   a regulation of the way in which people participate, the

 9   method of their payment in the health care market.                        That

10   is what it is.

11                  And I do think, Justice Kennedy, getting

12   back to the question you asked before, what -- what

13   matters here is whether Congress is choosing a tool

14   that's reasonably adapted to the problem that Congress

15   is confronting.     And that may mean that the tool is

16   different from a tool that Congress has chosen to use in

17   the past.     That's not something that counts against the

18   provision in a Commerce Clause analysis.

19                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Wait.           That's -- that's -­

20   it's both "Necessary and Proper."                        What you just said

21   addresses what's necessary.               Yes, has to be reasonably

22   adapted.     Necessary does not mean essential, just

23   reasonably adapted.       But in addition to being necessary,

24   it has to be proper.        And we've held in two cases that

25   something that was reasonably adapted was not proper

                                        26

 1   because it violated the sovereignty of the States, which

 2   was implicit in the constitutional structure.

 3             The argument here is that this also is -- may be

 4   necessary, but it's not proper because it violates an

 5   equally evident principle in the Constitution, which is

 6   that the Federal Government is not supposed to be a

 7   government that has all powers; that it's supposed to be

 8   a government of limited powers.                   And that's what all

 9   this questioning has been about.                    What -- what is left?

10   If the government can do this, what, what else can it

11   not do?

12                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              This does not violate the

13   norm of proper as this Court articulated it in Printz or

14   in New York because it does not interfere with the

15   States as sovereigns.         This is a regulation that -- this

16   is a regulation -­

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            No, that wasn't my point.

18   That is not the only constitutional principle that

19   exists.

20                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              But it -­

21                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            An equally evident

22   constitutional principle is the principle that the

23   Federal Government is a government of enumerated powers

24   and that the vast majority of powers remain in the

25   States and do not belong to the Federal Government.                     Do

 1   you acknowledge that that's a principle?

 2                GENERAL VERRILLI:                Of course we do, Your

 3   Honor.

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:              Okay.          That's what we are

 5   talking about here.

 6                GENERAL VERRILLI:                And the way in which this

 7   Court in its cases has policed the boundary that -- of

 8   what's in the national sphere and what's in the local

 9   sphere is to ask whether Congress is regulating economic

10   activity with a substantial effect on interstate

11   commerce.   And here I think it's really impossible, in

12   view of our history, to say that Congress is invading

13   the State sphere.     This is a -- this is a market in

14   which 50 percent of the people in this country get their

15   health care through their employer.                       There is a massive

16   Federal tax subsidy of $250 billion a year that makes

17   that much more affordable.               ERISA and HIPAA regulate

18   that to ensure that the kinds of bans on pre-existing

19   condition discrimination and pricing practices that

20   occur in the individual market don't occur.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I mean, the Tenth Amendment

 2   says the powers not given to the Federal Government are

 3   reserved, not just to the States, but to the States and

 4   the people.    And the argument here is that the people

 5   were left to decide whether they want to buy insurance

 6   or not.

 7                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              But this -- but, Your

 8   Honor, this is -- what the Court has said, and I think

 9   it would be a very substantial departure from what the

10   Court has said, is that when Congress is regulating

11   economic activity with a substantial effect on

12   interstate commerce that will be upheld.                      And that is

13   what is going on here, and to embark on -- I would

14   submit with all due respect, to embark on the kind of

15   analysis that my friends on the other side suggest the

16   Court ought to embark on is to import Lochner-style

17   substantive due process -­

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    The key in Lochner

19   is that we were talking about regulation of the States,

20   right, and the States are not limited to enumerated

21   powers.   The Federal Government is.                     And it seems to me

22   it's an entirely different question when you ask

23   yourself whether or not there are going to be limits in

24   the Federal power, as opposed to limits on the States,

25   which was the issue in Lochner.

 1                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              I agree, except,

 2   Mr. Chief Justice, that what the Court has said as I

 3   read the Court's cases is that the way in which you

 4   ensure that the Federal Government stays in its sphere

 5   and the sphere reserved for the States is protected is

 6   by policing the boundary:             Is the national government

 7   regulating economic activity with a substantial effect

 8   on interstate commerce?

 9                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But the reason, the reason

10   this is concerning, is because it requires the

11   individual to do an affirmative act.                     In the law of

12   torts our tradition, our law, has been that you don't

13   have the duty to rescue someone if that person is in

14   danger.   The blind man is walking in front of a car and

15   you do not have a duty to stop him absent some relation

16   between you.     And there is some severe moral criticisms

17   of that rule, but that's generally the rule.

18                  And here the government is saying that the

19   Federal Government has a duty to tell the individual

20   citizen that it must act, and that is different from

21   what we have in previous cases and that changes the

22   relationship of the Federal Government to the individual

23   in the very fundamental way.

24                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              I don't think so, Justice

25   Kennedy, because it is predicated on the participation

                                        30

 1   of these individuals in the market for health care

 2   services.    Now, it happens to be that this is a market

 3   in which, aside from the groups that the statute

 4   excludes, virtually everybody participates.                      But it is a

 5   regulation of their participation in that market.

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, but it's

 7   critical how you define the market.                      If I understand the

 8   law, the policies that you're requiring people to

 9   purchase involve -- must contain provision for maternity

10   and newborn care, pediatric services, and substance use

11   treatment.    It seems to me that you cannot say that

12   everybody is going to need substance use treatment,

13   substance use treatment or pediatric services, and yet

14   that is part of what you require them to purchase.

15                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, it's part of what

16   the statute requires the insurers to offer.                      And I think

17   the reason is because it's trying to define minimum

18   essential coverage because the problem -­

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But your theory is

20   that there is a market in which everyone participates

21   because everybody might need a certain range of health

22   care services, and yet you're requiring people who are

23   not -- never going to need pediatric or maternity

24   services to participate in that market.

25                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              The -- with respect to

 1   what insurance has to cover, Your Honor, I think

 2   Congress is entitled the latitude of making the

 3   judgments of what the appropriate scope of coverage is.

 4   And the problem here in this market is that for -- you

 5   may think you're perfectly healthy and you may think

 6   that you're not -- that you're being forced to subsidize

 7   somebody else, but this is not a market in which you can

 8   say that there is a immutable class of healthy people

 9   who are being forced to subsidize the unhealthy.                        This

10   is a market in which you may be healthy one day and you

11   may be a very unhealthy participant in that market the

12   next day and that is a fundamental difference, and

13   you're not going to know in which -­

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I think you're

15   posing the question I was posing, which is that doesn't

16   apply to a lot of what you're requiring people to

17   purchase:   Pediatric services, maternity services.                       You

18   cannot say that everybody is going to participate in the

19   substance use market and yet you require people to

20   purchase insurance coverage for that.

21                GENERAL VERRILLI:              Congress has got --

22   Congress is enacting economic regulation here.                     It has

23   latitude to define essential, the attributes of

24   essential coverage.     That doesn't -- that doesn't seem

25   to me to implicate the question of whether Congress is

 2   problem here, and that is what Congress is doing.

 3                 JUSTICE ALITO:            Are you denying this?         If

 4   you took the group of people who are subject to the

 5   mandate and you calculated the amount of health care

 6   services this whole group would consume and figured out

 7   the cost of an insurance policy to cover the services

 8   that group would consume, the cost of that policy would

 9   be much, much less than the kind of policy that these

10   people are now going to be required to purchase under

11   the Affordable Care Act?

12                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, while they are

13   young and healthy that would be true.                    But they are not

14   going to be young and healthy forever.                    They are going

15   to be on the other side of that actuarial equation at

16   some point.    And of course you don't know which among

17   that group is the person who's going to be hit by the

18   bus or get the definitive diagnosis.                    And that -­

19                 JUSTICE ALITO:            The point is -- no, you take

20   into account that some people in that group are going to

21   be hit by a bus, some people in that group are going to

22   unexpectedly contract or be diagnosed with a disease

23   that -- that is very expensive to treat.                    But if you

24   take their costs and you calculate that, that's a lot

25   less than the amount that they are going to be required

 1   to pay.

 2                 So that you can't just justify this on the

 3   basis of their trying to shift their costs off to other

 4   people, can you?

 5                 GENERAL VERRILLI:               Well, the -- the people

 6   in that class get benefits, too, Justice Alito.                  They

 7   get the guaranteed-issue benefit that they would not

 8   otherwise have, which is an enormously valuable benefit.

 9                 And in terms of the -- the subsidy

10   rationale, I -- I don't think -- I think it's -- it

11   would be unusual to say that it's an illegitimate

12   exercise of the commerce power for some people to

13   subsidize others.     Telephone rates in this country for a

14   century were set via the exercise of the commerce power

15   in a way in which some people paid rates that were much

16   higher than their costs in order to subsidize -­

18   calls.

 5   think that they're never going to buy it.

 6                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              That's the problem,

 7   Justice Scalia.    That's -- and that's exactly the

 8   experience that the States had that made the imposition

 9   of guaranteed-issue and community rating not only be

10   ineffectual but be highly counterproductive.                       Rates, for

11   example, in New Jersey doubled or tripled, went from

12   180,000 people covered in this market down to 80,000

13   people covered in this market.

14                 In Kentucky, virtually every insurer left

15   the market.    And the reason for that is because when

16   people have that guarantee of -- that they can get

17   insurance, they're going to make that calculation that

18   they won't get it until they're sick and they need it,

19   and so the pool of people in the insurance market gets

20   smaller and smaller.       The rates you have to charge to

21   cover them get higher and higher.                       It helps fewer and

22   fewer -- insurance covers fewer and fewer people until

23   the system ends.

24                 This is not a situation in which you're

25   conscripting -- you're forcing insurance companies to

                                       36

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:              You could solve that

 3   problem by simply not requiring the insurance company to

 4   sell it to somebody who has a -- a condition that is

 5   going to require medical treatment, or at least not -­

 6   not require them to sell it to him at -- at a rate that

 7   he sells it to healthy people.

 8                But you don't want to do that.

 9                GENERAL VERRILLI:                But that seems to me to

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:              That seems to me a

13   self-created problem.

14                GENERAL VERRILLI:                Congress cannot solve the

15   problem through standard economic regulation, and

16   that -- and -- and I do not think that can be the

17   premise of our understanding of the Commerce Clause -­

 1                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              This is not a -- it's not

 2   a problem of Congress's creation.                        The problem is that

 3   you have 40 million people who cannot get affordable

 4   insurance through the means that the rest of us get

 5   affordable insurance.         Congress, after a long study and

 6   careful deliberation, and viewing the experiences of the

 7   States and the way they tried to handle this problem,

 8   adopted a package of reforms.                 Guaranteed-issue and

 9   community rating, and -- and subsidies and the minimum

10   coverage provision are a package of reforms that solve

11   that problem.

12                  I don't -- I think it's highly artificial to

13   view this as a problem of Congress's own creation.

14                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Is your argument

15   limited to insurance or means of paying for health care?

16                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              Yes.         It's limited to

17   insurance.

18                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Well, now why is

19   that?     Congress could -- once you -- once you establish

20   that you have a market for health care, I would suppose

21   Congress's power under the Commerce Clause meant they

22   had a broad scope in terms of how they regulate that

23   market.     And it would be -- it would be going back to

24   Lochner if we were put in the position of saying no, you

25   can use your commerce power to regulate insurance, but

                                        38

 1   you can't use your commerce power to regulate this

 2   market in other ways.        I think that would be a very

 3   significant intrusion by the Court into Congress's

 4   power.

 5                 So I don't see how we can accept your -­

 6   it's good for you in this case to say oh, it's just

 7   insurance.    But once we say that there is a market and

 8   Congress can require people to participate in it, as

 9   some would say -- or as you would say, that people are

10   already participating in it -- it seems to me that we

11   can't say there are limitations on what Congress can do

12   under its commerce power, just like in any other area,

13   all -- given significant deference that we accord to

14   Congress in this area, all bets are off, and you could

15   regulate that market in any rational way.

16                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              But this is insurance as

17   a method of payment for health care services -­

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Exactly.

19                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              And that -- and that

20   is -­

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    And you're

22   worried -- that's the area that Congress has chosen to

23   regulate.    There's this health care market.                      Everybody's

24   in it.   So we can regulate it, and we're going to look

25   at a particular serious problem, which is how people pay

                                       39

 1   for it.   But next year, they can decide everybody's in

 2   this market, we're going to look at a different problem

 3   now, and this is how we're going to regulate it.                         And we

 4   can compel people to do things -- purchase insurance, in

 5   this case.   Something else in the next case, because

 6   you've -- we've accepted the argument that this is a

 7   market in which everybody participates.

 8                GENERAL VERRILLI:              Mr. Chief Justice, let me

 9   answer that, and then if I may, I'd like to move to the

10   tax power argument.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Can -- can I tell you what

12   the something else is so -- while you're answering it?

13   The something else is everybody has to exercise, because

14   there's no doubt that lack of exercise cause -- causes

15   illness, and that causes health care costs to go up.

16                So the Federal government says everybody has

17   to -- to join a -- an exercise club.                     That's -- that's

18   the something else.

19                GENERAL VERRILLI:              No.        The -- the position

20   we're taking here would not justify that rule, Justice

21   Scalia, because health club membership is not a means of

22   payment for -- for consumption of anything in -- in a

23   market.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Right.   Right.

 1   responsive to my concern that there's no reason -- once

 2   we say this is within Congress's commerce power, there's

 3   no reason other than our own arbitrary judgment to say

 4   all they can regulate is the method of payment.                         They

 5   can regulate other things that affect this now-conceded

 6   interstate market in health care in which everybody

 7   participates.

 8                GENERAL VERRILLI:              But I think it's common

 9   ground between us and the Respondents that this is an

10   interstate market in which everybody participates.                         And

11   they agree that -- that Congress could impose the

12   insurance requirement at the point of sale.                      And this is

13   just a question of timing, and whether Congress's -­

14   whether the necessary and proper authority gives

15   Congress, because of the particular features of this

16   market, the ability to impose the -- the insurance, the

17   need for insurance, the maintenance of insurance before

18   you show up to get health care rather than at the moment

19   you get up to show -­

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Right.   No, I

23   care.   And that -­

 1   idea that this is the regulation of the method of

 2   payment.   And I understand that argument.                And it may be

 3   -- it may be a good one.          But what I'm concerned about

 4   is, once we accept the principle that everybody is in

 5   this market, I don't see why Congress's power is limited

 6   to regulating the method of payment and doesn't include

 7   as it does in any other area.

 8                What other area have we said Congress can

 9   regulate this market but only with respect to prices,

10   but only with respect to means of travel?                 No.   Once

11   you're -- once you're in the interstate commerce and can

12   regulate it, pretty much all bets are off.

13                GENERAL VERRILLI:              But we agree Congress can

14   regulate this market.       ERISA regulates this market.

15   HIPAA regulates this market.              The -- the market is

16   regulated at the Federal level in very significant ways

17   already.   So I don't think that's the question,

18   Mr. Chief Justice.     The question is, is there a limit to

19   the authority that we're advocating here under the

20   commerce power, and the answer is yes, because we are

21   not advocating for a power that would allow Congress to

22   compel purchases -­

 1   people to purchase a product where the failure to

 2   purchase the product has a substantial effect on

 3   interstate commerce -- if what?                  If this is part of a

 4   larger regulatory scheme?            Was that it?        Was there

 5   anything more?

 6               GENERAL VERRILLI:                We got two and they

 7   are -- they are different.              Let me state them.      First

 8   with respect to the comprehensive scheme.                  When Congress

 9   is regulating -- is enacting a comprehensive scheme that

10   it has the authority to enact that the Necessary and

11   Proper Clause gives it the authority to include

12   regulation, including a regulation of this kind, if it

13   is necessary to counteract risks attributable to the

14   scheme itself that people engage in economic activity

15   that would undercut the scheme.                  It's like -- it's very

16   much like Wickard in that respect, very much like Raich

17   in that respect.

18               With respect to the -- with respect to

19   the -- considering the Commerce Clause alone and not

20   embedded in the comprehensive scheme, our position is

21   that Congress can regulate the method of payment by

22   imposing an insurance requirement in advance of the time

23   in which the -- the service is consumed when the class

24   to which that requirement applies either is or virtually

25   is most certain to be in that market when the timing of

                                       43

 1   one's entry into that market and what you will need when

 2   you enter that market is uncertain and when -- when you

 3   will get the care in that market, whether you can afford

 4   to pay for it or not and shift costs to other market

 5   participants.

 6               So those -- those are our views as to -­

 7   those are the principles we are advocating for and it's,

 8   in fact, the conjunction of the two of them here that

 9   makes this, we think, a strong case under the Commerce

10   Clause.

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               General, could you turn

12   to the tax clause?

13               GENERAL VERRILLI:              Yes.

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I have to look for a

15   case that involves the issue of whether something

16   denominated by Congress as a penalty was nevertheless

17   treated as a tax, except in those situations where the

18   code itself or the statute itself said treat the penalty

19   as a tax.

20               Do you know of any case where we've done

21   that?

22               GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, I think I would

23   point the Court to the License Tax Case, where it was -­

24   was denominated a fee and nontax, and the Court upheld

25   it as an exercise of the taxing power, in a situation in

                                     44

 1   which the structure of the law was very much the

 2   structure of this law, in that there was a separate

 3   stand-alone provision that set the predicate and then a

 4   separate provision in closing -­

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:              But fees, you know, license

 6   fees, fees for a hunting license, everybody knows those

 7   are taxes.   I mean, I don't think there is as much of a

 8   difference between a fee and a tax as there is between a

 9   penalty and a tax.

10                GENERAL VERRILLI:                And that, and -- and I

11   think in terms of the tax part, I think it's useful to

12   separate this into two questions.                        One is a question of

13   characterization.     Can this be characterized as a tax;

14   and second, is it a constitutional exercise of the

15   power?

16                With respect to the question of

17   characterization, the -- this is -- in the Internal

18   Revenue Code, it is administered by the IRS, it is paid

19   on your Form 1040 on April 15th, I think -­

22   through the tax code that are not taxes and they are not

23   penalties related to taxes.

24                GENERAL VERRILLI:                They may still be

25   exercise of the tax -- exercises of the taxing power,

 1   Justice Ginsburg, as -- as this is, and I think there

 2   isn't a case in which the Court has, to my mind,

 3   suggested anything that bears this many indicia of a tax

 4   can't be considered as an exercise of the taxing power.

 5   In fact, it seems to me the License Tax Cases point you

 6   in the opposite direction.             And beyond that your -­

 7   the -- it seems to me the right way to think about this

 8   question is whether it is capable of being understood as

 9   an exercise of the tax.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:            The President said it

11   wasn't a tax, didn't he?

12                GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, Justice Scalia,

13   what the -- two things about that, first, as it seems to

14   me, what matters is what power Congress was exercising.

15   And they were -- and I think it's clear that -- that

16   the -- the -- they were exercising the tax power as well

17   as -­

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:            You're making two

19   arguments.   Number one, it's a tax; and number two, even

20   if it isn't a tax, it's within the taxing power.                I'm

21   just addressing the first.

 1   wasn't a tax increase because it ought to be understood

 2   as an incentive to get people to have insurance.                        I

 3   don't think it's fair to infer from that anything about

 4   whether that is an exercise of the tax power or not.

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:                A tax is to raise

 6   revenue, tax is a revenue-raising device, and the

 7   purpose of this exaction is to get people into the

 8   health care risk -- risk pool before they need medical

 9   care, and so it will be successful.                        If it doesn't raise

10   any revenue, if it gets people to buy the insurance,

11   that's -- that's what this penalty is -- this penalty is

12   designed to affect conduct.

13                The conduct is buy health protection, buy

14   health insurance before you have a need for medical

15   care.   That's what the penalty is designed to do, not to

16   raise revenue.

17                GENERAL VERRILLI:                That -- that is true,

18   Justice Ginsburg.     This is also true of the marijuana

19   tax that was withheld in Sanchez.                        That's commonly true

20   of penalties under the Code.                They do -- if they raise

21   revenue, they are exercises of the taxing power, but

22   their purpose is not to raise revenue.                        Their purpose is

23   to discourage behavior.

24                I mean, the -- the mortgage deduction works

25   that way.   When the mortgage deduction is -- it's

 1   clearly an exercise of the taxing power.                   When it's

 2   successful it raises less revenue for the Federal

 3   Government.    It's still an exercise of the taxing power.

 5                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            I suppose, though, General,

 6   one question is whether the determined efforts of

 7   Congress not to refer to this as a tax make a

 8   difference.    I mean, you're suggesting we should just

 9   look to the practical operation.                   We shouldn't look at

10   labels.   And that seems right, except that here we have

11   a case in which Congress determinedly said this is not a

12   tax, and the question is why should that be irrelevant?

13                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              I don't think that that's

14   a fair characterization of the actions of Congress here,

15   Justice Kagan.    On the -- December 23rd, a point of

16   constitutional order was called to, in fact, with

17   respect to this law.       The floor sponsor, Senator Baucus,

18   defended it as an exercise of the taxing power.                   In his

19   response to the point of order, the Senate voted 60 to39

20   on that proposition.

21                 The legislative history is replete with

22   members of Congress explaining that this law is

23   constitutional as an exercise of the taxing power.                     It

24   was attacked as a tax by its opponents.                   So I don't

25   think this is a situation where you can say that

                                       48

 1   Congress was avoiding any mention of the tax power.

 2                 It would be one thing if Congress explicitly

 3   disavowed an exercise of the tax power.                      But given that

 4   it hasn't done so, it seems to me that it's -- not only

 5   is it fair to read this as an exercise of the tax power,

 6   but this Court has got an obligation to construe it as

 7   an exercise of the tax power, if it can be upheld on

 8   that basis.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Why didn't Congress

10   call it a tax, then?

11                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well -­

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    You're telling me

13   they thought of it as a tax, they defended it on the tax

14   power.    Why didn't they say it was a tax?

15                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              They might have thought,

16   Your Honor, that calling it a penalty as they did would

17   make it more effective in accomplishing its objective.

18   But it is -- in the Internal Revenue Code it is

19   collected by the IRS on April 15th.                      I don't think this

20   is a situation in which you can say -­

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, that's the

22   reason.    They thought it might be more effective if they

23   called it a penalty.

24                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, I -- you know, I

 1   illuminates that, but certainly -­

 2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               General, the problem

 3   goes back to the limiting principle.                    Is this simply

 4   anything that raises revenue that Congress can do?

 5               GENERAL VERRILLI:              No.        There are certain

 6   limiting principles under the -­

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So there has to be a

 8   limiting principle -­

 9               GENERAL VERRILLI:              -- taxing power, and

10   they -- and I think, of course, the Constitution imposes

11   some, got to be uniform, can't be taxed on exports, if

12   it's a direct tax, it's got to be apportioned.                    Beyond

13   that, the limiting principle, as the Court has

14   identified from Drexel Furniture to Kurth Ranch, is that

15   it can't be punishment, punitive in the guise of a tax.

16   And there are three factors of Court has identified to

17   look at that.

18               The first is the sanction and how

19   disproportionate it is to the conduct; the second is

20   whether there is scienter; and the third is whether

21   there is an -- an -- an administrative apparatus out

22   there to enforce the tax.

23               Now in -- in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture, for

24   example, the tax was 10 percent of the company's

25   profits, even if they had only one child laborer for one

                                     50

 1   day.     There was a scienter requirement, and it was

 2   enforced by the Department of Labor.                       It wasn't just

 3   collected by the Internal Revenue Service.

 4                  Here you don't have any of those things.

 5   This -- the -- the penalty is calculated to be no more

 6   than, at most, the equivalent of what one would have

 7   paid for insurance if you forgone.                       There is no scienter

 8   requirement, there is no enforcement apparatus out

 9   there.     So, certain -­

10                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Can the -- can the mandate

11   be viewed as tax if it does impose a requirement on

12   people who are not subject to the penalty or the tax?

13                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              I think it could, for the

14   reasons I -- I discussed yesterday.                       I don't think it

15   can or should be read that way.                   But if there is any

16   doubt about that, Your Honor, if there is -- if -- if it

17   is the view of the Court that it can't be, then I think

18   the -- the right way to handle this case is by analogy

19   to New York v. United States, in which the -- the Court

20   read the shall provision, shall handle the level of

21   radioactive waste as setting the predicate, and then the

 1                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 2            ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS FLORIDA, ET AL.

 3                  MR. CLEMENT:         Mr. Chief Justice and may it

 4   please the Court.     The mandate represents an

 5   unprecedented effort by Congress to compel individuals

 6   to enter commerce in order to better regulate commerce.

 7                  The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power

 8   to regulate existing commerce.                  It does not give

 9   Congress the far greater power to compel people to enter

10   commerce to create commerce essentially in the first

11   place.

12                  Now, Congress when it passed the statute did

13   make findings about why it thought it could regulate the

14   commerce here, and it justified the mandate as a

15   regulation of the economic decision to forego the

16   purchase of health insurance.                 That is a theory without

17   any limiting principle.

18                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Do you accept your -­

19   the General's position that you have conceded that

20   Congress could say, if you're going to consume health

21   services, you have to pay by way of insurance?

22                  MR. CLEMENT:         That's right,

23   Justice Sotomayor.      We say, consistent with 220 years of

24   this Court's jurisprudence, that if you regulate the

25   point of sale, you regulate commerce, that's within

                                        53

 1   Congress' commerce power.

 2                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               All right.   So what do

 3   you do with the impossibility of buying insurance at the

 4   point of consumption.        Virtually, you force insurance

 5   companies to sell it to you?

 6                 MR. CLEMENT:         Well, Justice, I think there

 7   is two points to make on that.                 One is, a lot of the

 8   discussion this morning so far has proceeded on the

 9   assumption that the only thing that is at issue here is

10   emergency room visits, and the only thing that's being

11   imposed is catastrophic care coverage; but, as the Chief

12   Justice indicated earlier, a lot of the insurance that's

13   being covered is for ordinary preventive care, ordinary

14   office visits, and those are the kinds of things that

15   one can predict.

16                 So there is a big part of the market that's

17   regulated here that wouldn't pose the problem that

18   you're suggesting; but, even as to emergency room

19   visits, it certainly would be possible to regulate at

20   that point.    You could simply say, through some sort of

21   mandate on the insurance companies, you have to provide

22   people that come in -- this will be a high-risk pool,

23   and maybe you will have to share it amongst yourself or

24   something, but people simply have to sign up at that

25   point, and that would be regulating at the point of

                                       54

 1   sale.

 2                JUSTICE KAGAN:              Well, Mr. Clement, now it

 3   seems as though you're just talking about a matter of

 4   timing; that Congress can regulate the transaction, and

 5   the question is when does it make best sense to regulate

 6   that transaction?

 7                And Congress surely has within its authority

 8   to decide, rather than at the point of sale, given an

 9   insurance-based mechanism, it makes sense to regulate it

10   earlier.   It's just a matter of timing.

11                MR. CLEMENT:           Well, Justice Kagan, we don't

12   think it's a matter of timing alone, and we think it has

13   very substantive effects.             Because if Congress tried to

14   regulate at the point of sale, the one group that it

15   wouldn't capture at all are the people who don't want to

16   purchase health insurance and also have no plans of

17   using health care services in the near term.                And

18   Congress very much wanted to capture those people.                 I

19   mean, those people are essentially the golden geese that

20   pay for the entire lowering of the premium.

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Was the government's

22   argument this -- and maybe I won't state it

23   accurately -- it is true that the noninsured young adult

24   is, in fact, an actuarial reality insofar as our

25   allocation of health services, insofar as the way health

                                        55

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   insurance companies figure risks?

 2                That person who is sitting at home in his or

 3   her living room doing nothing is an actuarial reality

 4   that can and must be measured for health service

 5   purposes; is that their argument?

 6                MR. CLEMENT:         Well, I don't know,

 7   Justice Kennedy, but, if it is, I think there is at

 8   least two problems with it.

 9                One is, as Justice Alito's question

10   suggested earlier, I mean, somebody who is not in the

11   insurance market is sort of irrelevant as an actuarial

12   risk.   I mean, we could look at the people not in the

13   insurance market, and what we'd find is that they're

14   relatively young, relatively healthy, and they would

15   have a certain pool of actuarial risks that would

16   actually lead to lower premiums.

17                The people that would be captured by

18   guaranteed rating and community issue -- guaranteed

19   issue and community rating would presumably have a

20   higher risk profile, and there would be higher premiums.

21                And one of the things, one of the things

22   Congress sought to accomplish here, was to force

23   individuals into the insurance market to subsidize those

24   that are already in it to lower the rates.             And that's

25   just not my speculation, that's Finding I at 43A of the

                                      56

 1   government's brief that -- it has the statute.                   And

 2   that's one of the clear findings.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Clement, doesn't that

 4   work -- that work the way Social Security does?

 5               Let me put it this way.                   Congress, in the

 6   '30s, saw a real problem of people needing to have old

 7   age and survivor's insurance.              And yes, they did it

 8   through a tax, but they said everybody has got to be in

 9   it because if we don't have the healthy in it, there's

10   not going to be the money to pay for the ones who become

11   old or disabled or widowed.            So they required everyone

12   to contribute.

13               It was a big fuss about that in the

14   beginning because a lot of people said -- maybe some

15   people still do today -- I could do much better if the

16   government left me alone.          I'd go into the private

17   market, I'd buy an annuity, I'd make a great investment,

18   and they're forcing me to paying for this Social

19   Security that I don't want; but, that's constitutional.

20               So if Congress could see this as a problem

21   when we need to have a group that will subsidize the

22   ones who are going to get the benefits, it seems to me

23   you are saying the only way that could be done is if the

24   government does it itself; it can't involve the private

25   market, it can't involve the private insurers.                   If it

                                     57

 1   wants to do this, Social Security is its model.                    The

 2   government has to do -- has to be government takeover.

 3   We can't have the insurance industry in it.                  Is that

 4   your position?

 5                 MR. CLEMENT:          No.       I don't think it is,

 6   Justice Ginsburg.     I think there are other options that

 7   are available.

 8                 The most straightforward one would be to

 9   figure out what amount of subsidy to the insurance

10   industry is necessary to pay for guaranteed issue and

11   community rating.     And once we calculate the amount of

12   that subsidy, we could have a tax that's spread

13   generally through everybody to raise the revenue to pay

14   for that subsidy.     That's the way we pay for most

15   subsidies.

16                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Could we have an

17   exemption?    Could the government say, everybody pays a

18   shared health care responsibility payment to offset all

19   the money that we are forced to spend on health care, we

20   the government; but, anybody who has an insurance policy

21   is exempt from that tax?            Could the government do that?

22                 MR. CLEMENT:          The government might be able

23   to do that.     I think it might raise some issues about

24   whether or not that would be a valid exercise of the

25   taxing power.

 7   credit for having health insurance and saving the

 8   government from caring for us.

 9               MR. CLEMENT:            Well, I think it would depend

10   a little bit on how it was formulated; but, my concern

11   would be -- the constitutional concern would be that it

12   would just be a disguised impermissible direct tax.                    And

13   I do think -- I mean, I don't want to suggest we get to

14   the taxing power to soon, but I do think it's worth

15   realizing that the taxing power is limited in the

16   ability to impose direct taxes.

17               And the one thing I think the framers would

18   have clearly identified as a direct tax is a tax on not

19   having something.

20               I mean, the framing generation was divided

21   over whether a tax on carriages was a direct tax or not.

22   Hamilton thought that was a indirect tax; Madison

23   thought it was a direct tax.                I have little doubt that

24   both of them would have agreed that a tax on not having

25   a carriage would have clearly been a direct tax.                    I also

                                        59

 1   think they would have thought it clearly wasn't a valid

 2   regulation of the market in carriages.

 3               And, you know, I mean, if you look at Hilton

 4   against the United States, that's this Court's first

 5   direct tax -­

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:            Let me ask -- can I go back

 7   for a step, because I don't want to get into a

 8   discussion of whether this is a good bill or not.               Some

 9   people think it's going to save a lot of money.               Some

10   people think it won't.

11               So I'm focusing just on the Commerce Clause;

12   not on the Due Process Clause, the Commerce Clause.                  And

13   I look back into history, and I think if we look back

14   into history we see sometimes Congress can create

15   commerce out of nothing.         That's the national bank,

16   which was created out of nothing to create other

17   commerce out of nothing.

18               I look back into history, and I see it seems

19   pretty clear that if there are substantial effects on

20   interstate commerce, Congress can act.

21               And I look at the person who's growing

22   marijuana in her house, or I look at the farmer who is

23   growing the wheat for home consumption.               This seems to

24   have more substantial effects.

25               Is this commerce?              Well, it seems to me more

                                     60

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   commerce than marijuana.           I mean, is it, in fact, a

 2   regulation?    Well, why not?            If creating a bank is, why

 3   isn't this?

 4                 And then you say, ah, but one thing here out

 5   of all those things is different, and that is you're

 6   making somebody do something.

 7                 I say, hey, can't Congress make people drive

 8   faster than 45 -- 40 miles an hour on a road?                 Didn't

 9   they make that man growing his own wheat go into the

10   market and buy other wheat for his -- for his cows?

11   Didn't they make Mrs. -- if she married somebody who had

12   marijuana in her basement, wouldn't she have to go and

13   get rid of it?    Affirmative action?

14                 I mean, where does this distinction come

15   from?   It sounds like sometimes you can, and sometimes

16   you can't.

17                 So what is argued here is there is a large

18   group of -- what about a person that we discover that

19   there are -- a disease is sweeping the United States,

20   and 40 million people are susceptible, of whom 10

21   million will die; can't the Federal Government say all

22   40 million get inoculation?

23                 So here, we have a group of 40 million, and

24   57 percent of those people visit emergency care or other

25   care, which we are paying for.                 And 22 percent of those

                                       61

 1   pay more than $100,000 for that.                  And Congress says they

 2   are in the midst of this big thing.                    We just want to

 3   rationalize this system they are already in.

 4                So, there, you got the whole argument, and I

 5   would like you to tell me -­

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:            We'll get to those

 7   questions in inverse order.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, no, it's one

 9   question.   It's looking back at that -- looking back at

10   that history.

11                The thing I can see that you say to some

12   people, go buy; why does that make a difference in terms

13   of the Commerce Clause?

14                MR. CLEMENT:         Well, Justice Breyer, let me

15   start at the beginning of your question with McCulloch.

16   McCulloch was not a commerce power case.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:            It was both?

18                MR. CLEMENT:         No, the bank was not justified

19   and the corporation was not justified as an exercise of

20   commerce power.   So that is not a case that says that

21   it's okay to conjure up the bank as an exercise of the

22   commerce power.

23                What, of course, the Court didn't say, and I

24   think the Court would have had a very different reaction

25   to, is, you know, we are not just going to have the

                                      62

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   bank, because that wouldn't be necessary and proper, we

 2   are going to force the citizenry to put all of their

 3   money in the bank, because, if we do that, then we know

 4   the Bank of the United States will be secure.

 5                I think the framers would have identified

 6   the difference between those two scenarios, and I don't

 7   think that the great Chief Justice would have said that

 8   forcing people to put their deposits in the Bank of the

 9   United States was necessary and proper.

10                Now, if you look through all the cases you

11   mentioned, I do not think you will find a case like

12   this.   And I think it's telling that you won't.                     I mean,

13   the regulation of the wheat market in Wickard against

14   Filburn, all this effort to address the supply side and

15   what producers could do, what Congress was trying to do

16   was support the price of wheat.                  It would have been much

17   more efficient to just make everybody in America buy 10

18   loaves of bread.   That would have had a much more direct

19   effect on the price of wheat in the prevailing market.

20                But we didn't do that.                     We didn't say when

21   we had problems in the automobile industry that we are

22   not just going to give you incentives, not just cash for

23   clunkers, we are going to actually have ever everybody

24   over 100,000 has to buy a new car -­

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Well, Mr. Clement,

                                       63

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the key to the government's argument to the contrary is

 2   that everybody is in this market.                        It's all right to

 3   regulate Wickard -- again, in Wickard against Filburn,

 4   because that's a particular market in which the farmer

 5   had been participating.

 6                  Everybody is in this market, so that makes

 7   it very different than the market for cars or the other

 8   hypotheticals that you came up with, and all they're

 9   regulating is how you pay for it.

10                  MR. CLEMENT:         Well, with respect, Mr. Chief

11   Justice, I suppose the first thing you have to say is

12   what market are we talking about?                        Because the

13   government -- this statute undeniably operates in the

14   health insurance market.            And the government can't say

15   that everybody is in that market.                        The whole problem is

16   that everybody is not in that market, and they want to

17   make everybody get into that market.

18                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, doesn't that seem a

19   little bit, Mr. Clement, cutting the bologna thin?                           I

20   mean, health insurance exists only for the purpose of

21   financing health care.          The two are inextricably

22   interlinked.     We don't get insurance so that we can

23   stare at our insurance certificate.                        We get it so that

24   we can go and access health care.

25                  MR. CLEMENT:         Well, Justice Kagan, I'm not

                                        64

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   sure that's right.     I think what health insurance does

 2   and what all insurance does is it allows you to

 3   diversify risk.   And so it's not just a matter of I'm

 4   paying now instead I'm paying later.                    That's credit.

 5   Insurance is different than credit.                    Insurance

 6   guarantees you an upfront, locked-in payment, and you

 7   won't have to pay any more than that even if you incur

 8   much great expenses.

 9               And in every other market that I know of for

10   insurance, we let people basically make the decision

11   whether they are relatively risk averse, whether they

12   are relatively non-risk averse, and they can make the

13   judgment based on -­

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                But we don't in car

15   insurance, meaning we tell people, buy car -- not we,

16   the states do, although you're going to -- I'll ask you

17   the question, do you think that if some states decided

18   not to impose an insurance requirement, that the Federal

19   Government would be without power to legislate and

20   require every individual to buy car insurance?

21               MR. CLEMENT:          Well, Justice Sotomayor, let

22   me say this, which is to say -- you're right in the

23   first point to say that it's the states that do it,

24   which makes it different right there.                    But it's also -­

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Well, that goes back to

                                      65

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the substantive due process question.                    Is this a Lochner

 2   era argument that only the states can do this, even

 3   though it affects commerce?               Cars indisputably affect

 4   commerce.   So are you arguing that because the states

 5   have done it all along, the Federal Government is no

 6   longer permitted to legislate in this area?

 7                MR. CLEMENT:           No.       I think you might make a

 8   different argument about cars than you would make about

 9   health insurance, unless you tried to say -- but, you

10   know, we're -­

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 Health insurance -- I

12   mean, I've never gotten into an accident, thankfully,

13   and I hope never.     The vast majority of people have

14   never gotten into an accident where they have injured

15   others; yet, we pay for it dutifully every year on the

16   possibility that at some point we might get into that

17   accident.

18                MR. CLEMENT:           But, Justice Sotomayor, what I

19   think is different is there is lots of people in

20   Manhattan, for example, that don't have car insurance

21   because they don't have cars.                 And so they have the

22   option of withdrawing from that market.                    It's not a

23   direct imposition from the government.

24                So even the car market is difference from

25   this market, where there is no way to get outside of the

                                        66

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   regulatory web.   And that's, I think, one of the real

 2   problems with this because, I mean, we take as a

 3   given -­

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               But you're -- but the

 5   given is that virtually everyone, absent some

 6   intervention from above, meaning that someone's life

 7   will be cut short in a fatal way, virtually everyone

 8   will use health care.

 9                MR. CLEMENT:         At some point, that's right,

10   but all sorts of people will not, say, use health care

11   in the next year, which is the relevant period for the

12   insurance.

13                JUSTICE BREYER:            But do you think you can,

14   better than the actuaries or better than the members of

15   Congress who worked on it, look at the 40 million people

16   who are not insured and say which ones next year will or

17   will not use, say, emergency care?

18                Can you do that any better than if we knew

19   that 40 million people were suffering, about to suffer a

20   contagious disease, and only 10 million would get

21   sick -­

22                MR. CLEMENT:         Of course not -­

23                JUSTICE BREYER:            -- and we don't know which?

24                MR. CLEMENT:         Of course not, Justice Breyer,

25   but the point is that once Congress decides it's going

                                      67

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to regulate extant commerce, it is going to get all

 2   sorts of latitude to make the right judgments about

 3   actuarial predictions, which actuarial to rely on, which

 4   one not to rely on.

 5               The question that's a proper question for

 6   this Court, though, is whether or not, for the first

 7   time ever in our history, Congress also has the power to

 8   compel people into commerce, because, it turns out, that

 9   would be a very efficient things for purposes of

10   Congress' optimal regulation of that market.

11               JUSTICE KAGAN:            But, Mr. Clement, this goes

12   back to the Chief Justice's question.                 But, of course,

13   the theory behind, not just the government's case, but

14   the theory behind this law is that people are in this

15   market right now, and they are in this market because

16   people do get sick, and because when people get sick, we

17   provide them with care without making them pay.

18               And it that would be different, you know, if

19   you were up here saying, I represent a class of

20   Christian scientists.      Then you might be able to say,

21   look, you know, why are they bothering me.                 But absent

22   that, you're in this market.             You're an economic actor.

23               MR. CLEMENT:         Well, Justice Kagan, once

24   again, it depends on which market we're talking about.

25   If we're talking about the health care insurance

                                     68

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   market -­

 2               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, we are talking about

 3   the health insurance market, which is designed to access

 4   the health care market.

 5               MR. CLEMENT:         And with respect to the health

 6   insurance market that's designed to have payment in the

 7   health care market, everybody is not in the market.               And

 8   that's the premise of the statute, and that's the

 9   problem Congress is trying to solve.

10               And if it tried to solve it through

11   incentives, we wouldn't be here; but, it's trying to

12   solve it in a way that nobody has ever tried to solve an

13   economic problem before, which is saying, you know, it

14   would be so much more efficient if you were just in this

15   market -­

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But they are in the market

17   in the sense that they are creating a risk that the

18   market must account for.

19               MR. CLEMENT:         Well, Justice Kennedy, I don't

20   think that's right, certainly in any way that

21   distinguishes this from any other context.             When I'm

22   sitting in my house deciding I'm not to buy a car, I am

23   causing the labor market in Detroit to go south.             I am

24   causing maybe somebody to lose their job, and for

25   everybody to have to pay for it under welfare.             So the

                                     69

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   cost shifting that the government tries to uniquely to

 2   associate with this market, it is everywhere.

 3                  And even more to the point, the rationale

 4   that they think ultimately supports this legislation,

 5   that look, it's an economic decision, once you make the

 6   economic decision, we aggregate the decision, there is a

 7   substantial effect on commerce.                   That argument works

 8   here.   It works in every single industry.

 9                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Of course we do know that

10   there are a few people, more in New York City than there

11   are in Wyoming, who never will buy a car.                   But we also

12   know here, and we don't like to admit it, that because

13   we are human beings we all suffer from the risk of

14   getting sick.     And we also all know that we'll get

15   seriously sick.     And we also know that we can't predict

16   when.   And we also know that when we do, there will be

17   our fellow taxpayers through the Federal Government who

18   will pay for this.      If we do not buy insurance, we will

19   pay nothing.     And that happens with a large number of

20   people in this group of 40 million, none of whom can be

21   picked out in advance.

22                  Now, that's quite different from a car

23   situation, and it's different in only this respect.                     It

24   shows there is a national problem, and it shows there is

25   a national problem that involves money, cost insurance.

 1   So if Congress could do this, should there be a disease

 2   that strikes the United States and they want every one

 3   inoculated even though ten million will be hurt, it's

 4   hard for me to decide why that isn't interstate

 5   commerce, even more so where we know it affects

 6   everybody.

 7                MR. CLEMENT:         Well, Justice Breyer, there

 8   are other markets that affect every one:

 9   transportation, food, burial services, though we don't

10   like to talk about that either.                 There also are

11   situations where there are many economic effects from

12   somebody's failure to purchase a product.

13                And if I could, if I could talk about the

14   difference between the health insurance market and the

15   health care market, I mean, ultimately I don't want you

16   to leave here with the impression that anything turns on

17   that.   Because if the government decided tomorrow that

18   they would come up with a great -- some of these -- some

19   private companies come up with a great new wonder drug

20   that would be great for everybody to take, would have

21   huge health benefits for everybody; and by the way, also

22   if everybody had to buy it, it would facilitate

23   economies of scale, and the production would be great,

24   and the price would be cheaper and force everybody in

25   the health care market, the actual health care market to

                                      71

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   buy the wonder drug, I'd be up here making the same

 2   argument.     I would be saying that's not a power that's

 3   within the commerce power of the Federal Government.                      It

 4   is something much greater.               And it would have been much

 5   more controversial.       That's why the important things.

 6   In Federalist 45, Madison says the commerce power.

 7   That's a new power, but it's not one anyone has any

 8   apprehension about.

 9                  The reason they didn't have any apprehension

10   about it is because it's a power that only operated once

11   people were already in commerce.                    You see that from the

12   text of the clause.       The first kind of commerce Congress

13   gets to regulate is commerce with foreign nations.                      Did

14   anybody think the fledgling Republic had the power to

15   compel some other nation into commerce with us?                    Of

16   course not.     And in the same way, I think if the framers

17   had understood the commerce power to include the power

18   to compel people to engage in commerce -­

19                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, once again though,

20   who's in commerce and what are they in commerce?

21                  If the effect of all these uninsured people

22   is to raise everybody's premiums, not just when they get

23   sick, if they get sick, but right now in the aggregate,

24   and Wickard and Raich tell us we should look at the

25   aggregate, and the aggregate of all these uninsured

                                        72

 1   people are increasing the normal family premium,

 2   Congress says, by a thousand dollars a year.                 Those

 3   people are in commerce.           They are making decisions that

 4   are affecting the price that everybody pays for this

 5   service.

 6                  MR. CLEMENT:         Justice Kagan, again, with all

 7   due respect, I don't think that's a limiting principle.

 8   My unwillingness to buy an electric car is forcing up

 9   the price of an electric car.                 If only more people

10   demanded an electric car there would be economies of

11   scale, and the price would go down.

12                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Not necessarily,

13   Mr. Clement.     And it's different because of the nature

14   of the health care service, that you are entitled to

15   health care when you go to an emergency room, when you

16   go to a doctor, even if you can't pay for it.                 So the

17   difference between your hypotheticals and the real case

18   is the problem of uncompensated care which -­

19                  MR. CLEMENT:         Justice Kagan, first of all, I

20   do think there -- this is not the only place where

21   there's uncompensated care.               If some -- if I don't buy a

22   car and somebody goes on welfare, I'm going to end up

23   paying for that as well.

24                  But let me also say that there is a real

25   disconnect then between that focus on what makes this

                                        73

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   different and statute that Congresses passed.                If all we

 2   were concerned about is the cost sharing that took place

 3   because of uncompensated care in emergency rooms,

 4   presumably we have before us a statute that only

 5   addressed emergency care and catastrophic insurance

 6   coverage.   But it covers everything, soup to nuts, and

 7   all sorts of other things.

 8                And that gets at the idea that there is two

 9   kinds of cost shifting that are going on here.                One is

10   the concern about emergency care and that somehow

11   somebody who gets sick is going to shift costs back to

12   other policy areas -- holders.                But there is a much

13   bigger cost shifting going on here, and that's the cost

14   shifting that goes on when you force healthy people into

15   an insurance market precisely because they are healthy,

16   precisely because they are not likely to go to the

17   emergency room, precisely because they are not likely to

18   use the insurance they are forced to buy in the health

19   care insurance.   That creates a huge windfall.               It

20   lowers the price of premiums.

21                And again, this is not just some lawyer up

22   here telling you that's what it does and trying to

23   second-guess the congressional economic decisions.                  This

24   is Congress's findings, findings I on page 43 A of the

25   appendix to the government's -­

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:            All that sounds like you're

 2   debating the merits of the bill.                  You ask really for

 3   limiting principles so we don't get into a matter that I

 4   think has nothing to do with this case:                     broccoli, okay?

 5                And the limiting principles, you've heard

 6   three.   First, the Solicitor General came up with a

 7   couple joined, very narrow ones.                  You've seen in Lopez

 8   this Court say that we cannot, Congress cannot get into

 9   purely local affairs, particularly where they are

10   noncommercial.   And, of course, the greatest limiting

11   principle of all, which not too many accept, so I'm not

12   going to emphasize that, is the limiting principle

13   derived from the fact that members of Congress are

14   elected from States and that 95 percent of the law of

15   the United States is State law.                 That is a principle

16   though enforced by the legislature.

17                The other two are principles, one written

18   into Lopez and one you just heard.                     It seems to me all

19   of those eliminate the broccoli possibility, and none of

20   them eliminates the possibility that we are trying to

21   take the 40 million people who do have the medical cost,

22   who do affect interstate commerce and provide a system

23   that you may like or not like.

24                That's where we are in limiting principles.

25                MR. CLEMENT:         Well, Justice Breyer, let me

                                      75

 1   take them in turn.     I would encourage this Court not to

 2   Garcia-ize the Commerce Clause and just simply say it's

 3   up to Congress to police the Commerce Clause.                 So I

 4   don't think that is a limiting principle.

 5               Second of all -­

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Yes, but that's exactly

 7   what Justice Marshall said in Gibbons.                 He said that it

 8   is the power to regulate, the power like all others

 9   vested in Congress is complete in itself, may be

10   exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no

11   limitations other than those prescribed in the

12   Constitution.   But there is no conscription in the, set

13   forth in the Constitution with respect to regulating

14   commerce.

15               MR. CLEMENT:          I agree 100 percent, and I

16   think that was the Chief Justice's point which was once

17   you open the door to compelling people into commerce

18   based on the narrow rationales that exist in this

19   industry, you are not going to be able to stop that

20   process.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I would like hear you

22   address Justice Breyer's other, other two principles.

23               MR. CLEMENT:          Well, the other two principles

24   are Lopez -- and this case really is not -- I mean, you

25   know, Lopez is a limit on the affirmative exercise of

                                      76

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   people who are already in commerce.                    The question is, is

 2   there any other limit to people who aren't in commerce?

 3   And so I think this is the case that really asks that

 4   question.

 5               And then the first point which was I take it

 6   to be the Solicitor General's point is, with all due

 7   respect, simply a description of the insurance market.

 8   It's not a limiting principle, because the justification

 9   for why this is a valid regulation of commerce is in no

10   way limited to this market.            It simply says, these are

11   economic decisions, they have effect on other people, my

12   failure to purchase in this market has a direct effect

13   on others who are already in the market.                    That's true of

14   virtually every other market under the sun.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    And now maybe return

16   to Justice Sotomayor's question.

17               MR. CLEMENT:         I'd be delighted to, which is

18   -- I mean, I -- you are absolutely right.                    Once you're

19   in the commerce power, there is not -- this Court is not

20   going to police that subject maybe to the Lopez limit.

21   And that's exactly why I think it's very important for

22   this Court to think seriously about taking an

23   unprecedented step of saying that the commerce power not

24   only includes the power to regulate, prescribe the rule

25   by which commerce is governed, the rule of Gibbons v.

                                     77

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Ogden.     But to go further and say it's not just

 2   prescribing the rule for commerce that exists but is the

 3   power to compel people to enter into commerce in the

 4   first place.

 5                  I would like to say two very brief things

 6   about the taxing power, if I could.                        There are lots of

 7   reasons why this isn't a tax.                 It wasn't denominated a

 8   tax.     It's not structured as a tax.                     If it's any tax at

 9   all, though, it is a direct tax.                    Article I, Section 9,

10   clause 4, the Framers would have had no doubt that a tax

11   on not having something is not an excise tax but a

12   forbidden direct tax.         That's one more reason why this

13   is not proper legislation because it violates that.

14                  The second thing is I would urge you to read

15   the License Tax case which the Solicitor General says is

16   his best case for why you ignore the fact that a tax is

17   denominated into something other.                        Because that is a

18   case where the argument was that because the Federal

19   government had passed a license not a tax, that somehow

20   that allowed people to take actions that would have been

21   unlawful under State law, that this was some special

22   Federal license to do something that was forbidden by

23   State law.     This Court looked beyond the label in order

24   to preserve federalism there.                 What the Solicitor

25   General and the government ask you to do here is exactly

                                        78

 1   the opposite, which is to look past labels in order to

 2   up-end our basic federalist system.                       In this -­

 3                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Would you tell me, do

 4   you think the States could pass this mandate.

 5                  MR. CLEMENT:         I represent 26 States.             I do

 6   think the States could pass this mandate, but I -­

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Is there any other area

 8   of commerce, business, where we have held that there is

 9   a concurrent power between the State and the Federal

10   Government to protect the welfare of commerce?

11                  MR. CLEMENT:         Well, Justice Sotomayor, I

12   have to resist your premise, because I didn't answer

13   yes, the States can do it because it would be a valid

14   regulation of intrastate commerce.                       I said yes, the

15   States can do it because they have a police power, and

16   that is the fundamental difference between the States on

17   the one hand and the limited, enumerated Federal

18   Government on the other.

 1               I'd like to begin with the Solicitor

 2   General's main premise, which is that they can compel

 3   the purchase of health insurance in order to promote

 4   commerce in the health market because it will reduce

 5   uncompensated care.     If you accept that argument, you

 6   have to fundamentally alter the text of the Constitution

 7   and give Congress plenary power.

 8               It simply doesn't matter whether or not this

 9   regulation will promote health care commerce by reducing

10   uncompensated care; all that matters is whether the

11   activity actually being regulated by the act negatively

12   affects Congress or negatively affects commerce

13   regulation, so that it's within the commerce power.                      If

14   you agree with us that this is -- exceeds commerce

15   power, the law doesn't somehow become redeemed because

16   it has beneficial policy effects in the health care

17   market.

18               In other words, Congress does not have the

19   power to promote commerce.             Congress has -- Congress has

20   the power to regulate commerce.                 And if the power

21   exceeds their permissible regulatory authority, then the

22   law is invalid.

 1   regulation includes the power to promote.                      Since the New

 2   Deal we've said that regulation in -- there is a market

 3   agricultural products; Congress has the power to

 4   subsidize, to limit production, all sorts of things.

 5                 MR. CARVIN:        Absolutely, Chief Justice, and

 6   that's the distinction I'm trying to draw.                      When they

 7   are acting within their enumerated power then obviously

 8   they are promoting commerce, but the

 9   Solicitor General wants to turn it into a different

10   power.   He wants to say we have the power to promote

11   commerce, to regulate anything to promote commerce, and

12   if they have the power to promote commerce then they

13   have the power to regulate everything, right?

14   Because -­

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I don't -- I don't

16   think you're addressing their main point, which is that

17   they are not creating commerce in -- in health care.

18   It's already there, and we are all going to need some

19   kind of health care; most of us will at some point.

20                 MR. CARVIN:        I'd -- I'd like to address that

21   in two ways, if I could, Mr. Chief Justice.                      In the

22   first place they keep playing mix and match with the

23   statistics.    They say 95 percent of us are in the health

24   care market, okay?     But that's not the relevant

25   statistic, even from -- as the government frames the

                                       81

 1   issue.   No one in Congress and the Solicitor General is

 2   arguing that going to the doctor and fully paying him

 3   creates a problem.     The problem is uncompensated care,

 4   and they say the uncompensated care arises if you have

 5   some kind of catastrophe -- hit by a bus, have some

 6   prolonged illness.     Well, what is the percentage of the

 7   uninsured that have those sorts of catastrophes?                     We

 8   know it has got to be a relative small fraction.                     So in

 9   other words, the relevant -­

13   know in advance, and -- and --                but that doesn't change

14   the basic principle, that you are nonetheless forcing

15   people for paternalistic reasons to go into the

16   insurance market to ensure against risk that they have

17   made the voluntary decision that they are not -- have

18   decided not to.   But even -­

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But the problem is -- the

20   problem is this they are making the reinvent of us pay

21   for it, because as much as they say, well, we are not in

22   the market, we don't know when the -- the timing when

23   they will be.

24                MR. CARVIN:        Which is -­

 1   that how much more families are paying for insurance

 2   because people get sick, they may have intended to

 3   self-insure, they haven't been able to meet the bill

 4   for -- for cancer, and the rest of us end up paying

 5   because these people are getting cost-free health care,

 6   and the only way to prevent that is to have them pay

 7   sooner rather than later, pay up front.

 8                 MR. CARVIN:        Yes, but my point is this.

 9   That, with respect, Justice Ginsburg, conflicts the

10   people who do result in uncompensated care, the free

11   riders.   Those are people who default on their health

12   care payments.    That is an entirely different group of

13   people, an entirely different activity than being

14   uninsured.

15                 So the question is whether or not you can

16   regulate activity because it has a statistical

17   connection to an activity that harms Congress.                 And my

18   basic point to you is this:              the Constitution only gives

19   Congress the power to regulate things that negatively

20   affect commerce or commerce regulation.                 It doesn't give

21   them the power to regulate things that are statistically

22   connected to things that negatively affect the

23   commerce -­

 2                MR. CARVIN:        I was just going to say,

 3   because if they have that power, then they obviously

 4   have the power to regulate everything because everything

 5   in the aggregate is statistically connected to something

 6   that negatively affects commerce, and every compelled

 7   purchase promotes commerce.

14   something.   I'd like to just -- if it turned out there

16   and we couldn't say that more than 40 or 50 percent -- I

17   can make the number as high as I want -- but the -- the

18   -- you'd say the Federal Government doesn't have the

19   power to get people inoculated, to require them to be

20   inoculated, because that's just statistical.

16   citizens as this communicable disease, but the --                  and

17   it has huge effects on the health care of our country.

 1                MR. CARVIN:        I -- I don't know why having a

 2   disease is any more local than -- that beating up a

 3   woman.   But -- but -- my basic point is, is that

 4   notwithstanding its very profound effect on the health

 5   care market, this Court said the activity being

 6   regulated, i.e., violence against women, is outside the

 7   Commerce Clause power.        So regardless of whether it has

 8   beneficial downstream effects, we must say no, Congress

 9   doesn't have that power.          Why not?             Because everything

10   has downstream effects on commerce and every compelled

11   purchase promotes commerce.             It by definition helps the

13                JUSTICE ALITO:            Mr. Carvin, isn't there this

14   difference between Justice Breyer's hypothetical and the

15   law that we have before us here?                  In his hypothetical

16   harm to other people from the communicable disease is

17   the result of the disease.             It is not the result of

18   something that the government has done, whereas here the

19   reason why there is cost shifting is because the

20   government has mandated that.               It has required hospitals

21   to provide emergency treatment, and instead of paying

22   for that through a tax which would be born by everybody,

23   it has required -- it has set up a system in which the

24   cost is surreptitiously shifted to people who have

25   health insurance and who pay their bills when they go to

 1   the hospital.

 2                  MR. CLEMENT:         Justice Alito, that is exactly

 3   the government's argument.               It's an extraordinarily

 4   illogical argument.

 5                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Fine.          Then if that's so,

 6   is -- let me just change my example under pressure -­

 8                  JUSTICE BREYER:            -- and say that in fact it

 9   turns out that 90 percent of all automobiles driving

10   interstate without certain equipment put up pollution,

11   which travels interstate -- not 100 percent, maybe only

12   60 percent.     Does the EPA have the power then to say

13   you've got to have an antipollution device?                       It's

14   statistical.

15                  MR. CARVIN:        What they can't do -- yes, if

16   you have a car, they can require you to have an

17   anti-pollution -­

18                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Then you're not going on

19   statistics; you're going on something else which is what

20   I'd like to know what it is.

21                  MR. CARVIN:        It's this.              They can't require

22   you to buy a car with an anti-pollution device.                          Once

23   you've entered the market and made a decision they can

24   regulate the terms and conditions of the car that you

25   do, and they can do it for all sorts of reasons.                          What

 1   they can't do it compel you to enter the market.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:            Now we -- now you've

 3   changed the ground of argument, which I accept as -- as

 4   totally legitimate.    And then the question is when you

 5   are born, and you don't have insurance, and you will in

 6   fact get sick, and you will in fact impose costs, have

 7   you perhaps involuntarily -- perhaps simply because you

 8   are a human being -- entered this particular market,

 9   which is a market for health care?

10               MR. CARVIN:        If being born is entering the

11   market, then I can't think of a more plenary power

12   Congress can have, because that literally means they can

13   regulate every human activity from cradle to grave.                  I

14   thought that's what distinguished the plenary police

15   power from the very limited commerce power.

16               I don't disagree that giving the Congress

17   plenary power to mandate property transfers from A to B

18   would be a very efficient way of helping B and of

19   accomplishing Congress's objectives.                  But the framers -­

 5   junior justice?

 6               (Laughter.)

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:                 It just seems very

 8   strange to me that there's no question we can have a

 9   Social Security system besides all the people who say:

10   I'm being forced to pay for something I don't want.                      And

11   this it seems to me, to try to get care for the ones who

12   need it by having everyone in the pool, but is also

13   trying to preserve a role for the private sector, for

14   the private insurers.         There's something very odd about

15   that, that the government can take over the whole thing

16   and we all say, oh, yes, that's fine, but if the

17   government wants to get -- to preserve private insurers,

18   it can't do that.

19               MR. CARVIN:           Well I don't think the test of

20   a law's constitutionality is whether it more adheres to

21   the libertarian principles of the Cato Institute or the

22   statist principles of someone else.                      I think the test of

23   a law's constitutionality is not those policy questions;

24   it's whether or not the law is regulating things that

25   negatively affect commerce or don't.

 1               And since obviously the failure to purchase

 2   an item doesn't create the kind of effects on supply and

 3   demand that the market participants in Wickard and Raich

 4   did and doesn't in any way interfere with regulation of

 5   the insurance companies, I don't think it can pass the

 6   basic -­

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I thought -- I thought

 8   that Wickard was you must buy; we are not going to let

 9   you use the home-grown wheat.              You have got to go out in

10   the market and buy that wheat that you don't want.

11               MR. CARVIN:        Oh, but let's be careful about

12   what they were regulating in Wickard, Justice Ginsburg.

13   What they were regulating was the supply of wheat.                     It

14   didn't in any way imply that they could require every

15   American to go out and buy wheat.                     And yes, one of the

16   consequences of regulating local market participants is

17   it'll affect the supply and the demand for the product.

18   That's why you can regulate them, because those local

19   market participants have the same effect on the

20   interstate market that a black market has on a legal

21   market.

22               But none of that is true -- in other words,

23   you can regulate local bootleggers, but that doesn't

24   suggest you can regulate teetotalers, people who stay

25   out of the liquor market, because they don't have any

 1   negative effect on the existing market participants or

 2   on regulation of those market participants.

 3                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            That's why I suggested, Mr.

 4   Carvin, that it might be different if you were raising

 5   an as-applied challenge and presenting a class of people

 6   whom you could say clearly would not be in the health

 7   care market.     But you're raising a facial challenge and

 8   we can't really know which, which of the many, many,

 9   people that this law addresses in fact will not

10   participate in the health care market and in fact will

11   not impose costs on all the rest of us.

12                  So the question is can Congress respond to

13   those facts, that we have no crystal ball, that we can't

14   tell who is and isn't going to be in the health

15   insurance market, and say most of these people will be

16   and most of these people will thereby impose costs on

17   the rest of us and that's a problem that we can deal

18   with on a class-wide basis?

19                  MR. CARVIN:        No again.              The people who

20   impose the costs on the rest of us are people who engage

21   in a different activity at a different time, which is

22   defaulting on their health care payments.                       It's not the

23   uninsured.     Under your theory you could regulate anybody

24   if they have got a statistical connection to a problem.

25   You could say, since we could regulate people who enter

 2   on them, we can simply impose the requirement to buy

 3   private mortgage insurance on everybody before they have

 4   entered the market because we are doing it in this

 5   prophylactic way before it develops.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    No, no, that's not

 7   -- I don't think that's fair, because not everybody is

 8   going to enter the mortgage market.                     The government's

 9   position is that almost everybody is going to enter the

10   health care market.

11                MR. CARVIN:        Two points, one of which

12   Mr. Clement's already made, which is the health

13   insurance market is different than the health care

14   market.   But let me take it on full-stride.                    I think

15   everybody is in the milk market.                  I think everybody is

16   in the wheat product market.              But that doesn't suggest

17   that the government compel you to buy five gallons of

18   meat or five bushels of wheat because they are not

19   regulating commerce.

20                Whether you're a market participant or not,

21   they are still requiring you to make a purchase that you

22   don't want to do, and to get back to your facial

 1   for example, all kinds of restrictions on States after

 2   they have enacted laws.          They can wipe out the laws.

 3   They can condition them.

 4                But what can't they do?                      They can't compel

 5   States to enact laws.        They can't compel States to carry

 6   out Federal law.   And I am arguing for precisely the

 7   same distinction, because everyone intuitively

 8   understands that regulating participants after A and B

 9   have entered into a contract is fundamentally less

10   intrusive than requiring the contract.

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                We let the government

12   regulate the manufacturing process whether or not the

13   goods will enter into interstate commerce, merely

14   because they might statistically.                       We -- there is all

15   sorts of government regulation of manufacturing plants,

16   of agricultural farms, of all sorts of activity that

17   will be purely intrastate because it might affect

18   interstate activity.

19                MR. CARVIN:         I fully agree with you, Justice

20   Sotomayor.   But I think -­

21                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                So how is that different

22   from saying you are self-insuring today, you're

23   foregoing insurance?       Why isn't that a predecessor to

24   the need that you're eventually going to have?

25                MR. CARVIN:         The cases you referred to I

 1   think effectively eliminated the distinction between

 2   participants in the intrastate market vis-à-vis

 3   participants in the interstate market.                  None of those

 4   cases suggest that you can regulate people who are

 5   outside of the market on both an intrastate and

 6   interstate level by compelling them to enter into the

 7   market.   And that -­

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What about -- the simplest

 9   counter-example for me to suggest is you've undoubtedly

10   read Judge Sutton's concurring opinion.                  He has about

11   two pages, it seemed to me, of examples where everyone

12   accepts the facts that under these kinds of regulations

13   the government can compel people to buy things they

14   don't otherwise want to buy.

15                 For example, he gives, even in that farm

16   case, the farmer who was being forced to go out and buy

17   grain to feed to his animals because he couldn't raise

18   it at home.    You know and he goes through one example

19   after another.    So what -- what is your response to

20   that, which you've read?

21                 MR. CARVIN:        Judge Sutton is wrong in each

22   and every example.      There was no -- there was no

23   compulsion in Raich for him to buy wheat.                  He could have

24   gotten wheat substitutes or he could have not sold

25   wheat, which is actually what he was doing.                  There is a

 1   huge difference between conditioning regulation, i.e.,

 2   conditioning access to the health care market and saying

 3   you must buy a product, and forcing you to buy a

 4   product.   And that, that -- I'm sorry.

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:               I thought it was common

 6   ground that the requirement that the insurers -- what

 7   was it, the community-based one and they have to insure

 8   you despite your health status; they can't refuse

 9   because of preexisting conditions.                      The government tells

10   us and the Congress determined that those two won't work

11   unless you have a pool that will include the people who

12   are now healthy.   But so -- well, first, do you agree

13   with your colleague that the community-based -- and

14   what's the name that they give to the other?

15                MR. CARVIN:         The guaranteed-issue.

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Yes.        That that is

17   legitimate Commerce Clause legislation?

18                MR. CARVIN:         Oh, sure.              And that's why -­

19   but we don't in any way impede that sort of regulation.

20   These nondiscrimination regulations will apply to every

21   insurance company just as Congress intended whether or

22   not we buy insurance.

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Well then, what about the

24   determination that they can't possibly work if people

25   don't have to buy insurance until they are -- their

 2   dealt with them on its -- as it will?                        I won't insure

 3   you because you're -- you're already sick.

 4                MR. CARVIN:          It depends what you mean by

 6   people are discriminated against.                        What -- what -- but

 9   would they insure early if they had to be protected if

10   they get insurance late?

11                MR. CARVIN:          Yes.        Well, that's -- this is

12   the government's very illogical argument.                        They seem to

13   be saying look, we couldn't just force people to buy

14   insurance to lower health insurance premiums.                        That

15   would be no good.     But we can do it because we've

16   created the problem.        We, Congress, have driven up the

17   health insurance premiums, and since we've created that

18   problem, this somehow gives us authority that we

19   wouldn't otherwise have.            That can't possibly be right.

 5   reaction and a simple shot would have saved the child?

 6               MR. CARVIN:        One of the more pernicious,

 7   misleading impressions that the government has made is

 8   that we are somehow advocating that people be -- could

 9   get thrown out of emergency rooms, or that this

10   alternative that they've hypothesized is going to be

11   enforced by throwing people out of emergency rooms.

12   This alternative; i.e. conditioned access to health care

13   on buying health insurance, is enforced in precisely the

14   same way that the Act does.            You either buy health

15   insurance or you pay a penalty of $695.                     You don't have

22   this strawman that says look, the only alternative to

23   doing it the way we've done it, if we condition access

24   to health care on buying health insurance, the only way

25   you can enforce that is making sick people not get care.

 1   I'm saying no, no. There's a perfectly legitimate way

 2   they could enforce their alternative; i.e. requiring you

 3   to buy health insurance when you access health care,

 4   which is the same penalty structure that's in the Act.

 5                  There is no moral dilemma between having

 6   people have insurance and denying them emergency

 7   service.   Congress has made a perfectly legitimate value

 8   judgment that they want to make sure that people get

 9   emergency care.     Since the founding, whenever Congress

10   has imposed that public responsibility on private

11   actors, it has subsidized it from the Federal Treasury.

12   It has not conscripted a subset of the citizenry and

13   made them subsidize the actors who are being hurt, which

14   is what they're doing here.

15                  They're making young healthy people

16   subsidize insurance premiums for the cost that the

17   nondiscrimination provisions have put on insurance

18   premiums and insurance companies.

24   Congress can tax everybody and set up a public health

25   care system.

 7   taking the same position as your colleague, Congress

 8   can't say we're going to set up a public health system,

 9   but you can get a tax credit if you have private health

10   insurance because you won't access the public system.

11                Are you taking the same position as your

14   confusion in prior colloquy.                I fully agree with my

15   brother Clement that a direct tax would be

16   unconstitutional.     I don't think he means to suggest,

17   nor do I, that a tax credit that incentivizes you to buy

18   insurance creates problems.               Congress incentivizes all

19   kinds of activities.        If they gave us a tax credit for

20   buying insurance, then it would be our choice whether or

21   not that makes economic sense, even though -­

 4   between banning cigarettes and saying I'm going to

18   recognizes that it's all taxation for the purposes of

19   dissuading you to buy it.

20                  MR. CARVIN:        That's precisely my point.              And

21   everyone intuitively understands that that system is

22   dramatically different than saying cigarettes tomorrow

23   are illegal.     It is different.

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:            It is different.       It is

25   different.     I agree with that.               But you pointed out, and

 1   I agree with you on this, that the government set up

 2   these emergency room laws.            The government set up

 3   Medicaid.   The government set up Medicare.                   The

 4   government set up CHIP, and there are 40 million people

 5   who don't have the private insurance.                    In that world,

 6   the government has set up commerce.                    It's all over the

 7   United States.   And in that world, of course, the

 8   decision by the 40 million not to buy the insurance

 9   affects that commerce, and substantially so.

10                So I thought the issue here is not whether

11   it's a violation of some basic right or something to

12   make people buy things they don't want, but simply

13   whether those decisions of that group of 40 million

14   people substantially affect the interstate commerce that

15   has been set up in part through these other programs.

16                So that's the part of your argument I'm not

17   hearing.

18                MR. CARVIN:        Let me -­

19                JUSTICE BREYER:            Please.

20                MR. CARVIN:        It is clear that the failure to

21   buy health insurance doesn't affect anyone.                    Defaulting

22   on your payments to your health care provider does.

23   Congress chose for whatever reason not to regulate the

24   harmful activity of defaulting on your health care

25   provider.   They used the 20 percent or whoever among the

                                     102

 1   uninsured as a leverage to regulate the 100 percent of

 2   the uninsured.

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:                I agree -- I agree that

 4   that's what's happening here.

 5               MR. CARVIN:           Okay.

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:                And the government tells

 7   us that's because the insurance market is unique.                   And

 8   in the next case, it'll say the next market is unique.

 9   But I think it is true that if most questions in life

10   are matters of degree, in the insurance and health care

11   world, both markets -- stipulate two markets -- the

12   young person who is uninsured is uniquely proximately

13   very close to affecting the rates of insurance and the

14   costs of providing medical care in a way that is not

15   true in other industries.

16               That's my concern in the case.

17               MR. CARVIN:           And, Your -- I may be

18   misunderstanding you, Justice Kennedy.                   I hope I'm not.

19               Sure.     It would be perfectly fine if they

20   allowed -- you do actuarial risk for young people on the

21   basis of their risk for disease, just like you judge

22   flood insurance on the homeowner's risk of flood.                   One

23   of the issues here is not only that they're compelling

24   us to enter into the marketplace, they're not -- they're

25   prohibiting us from buying the only economically

 1   sensible product that we would want.                   Catastrophic

 2   insurance.

 3                Everyone agrees the only potential problem

 4   that a 30-year-old, as he goes from the healthy 70

 5   percent of the population to the unhealthy 5 percent.

 6   And yet Congress prohibits anyone over 30 from buying

 7   any kind of catastrophic health insurance.                   And the

 8   reason they do that is because they needed this massive

 9   subsidy.

10                Justice Alito, it's not our numbers.                     CBO

11   said that injecting my clients into the risk pool lowers

12   premiums by 15 to 20 percent.               So, Justice Kennedy, even

13   if we were going to create exceptions for people that

14   are outside of commerce and inside of commerce, surely

15   we'd make Congress do a closer nexus and say look, we're

16   really addressing this problem.                 We want these

17   30-year-olds to get catastrophic health insurance.

18                And not only did they -- they deprived them

19   of that option.   And I think that illustrates the

20   dangers of giving Congress these plenary powers, because

21   they can always leverage them.                They can always come up

22   with some public policy rationale that converts the

23   power to regulate commerce into the power to promote

24   commerce, which, as I was saying before, is the one that

25   I think is plenary.

 6   activity/inactivity distinction, would force one to

 7   confront that problem all the time.

 8                  Now, if you look over the history of the

 9   Commerce Clause, what you see is that there were sort of

10   unhappy periods when the Court used tests like this -­

11   direct versus indirect, commerce versus manufacturing.

12   I think most people would say that those things didn't

13   really work.     And the question is, why should this test,

14   inactive versus active, work any better?

15                  MR. CARVIN:        The problem you identify is

16   exactly the problem you would create if you bought the

17   government's bogus limiting principles.                       You'd have to

18   draw distinctions between the insurance industry and the

19   car industry and all of that.

20                  We turn you to the Commerce Clause

21   jurisprudence that bedeviled the Court before the 1930s,

22   where they were drawing all these kinds of distinctions

23   among industries; whereas our test is really very

24   simple.   Are you buying the product or is Congress

25   compelling you to buy the product?                       I can't think of a

                                       105

 1   brighter line.

 2               And again, if Congress has the power to

 3   compel you to buy this product, then obviously, they

 4   have got the power to provide you -- to compel you to

 5   buy any product, because any purchase is going to

 6   benefit commerce, and this Court is never going to

 7   second-guess Congress's policy judgments on how

 8   important it is this product versus that product.

 9               JUSTICE ALITO:           Do you think they are

10   drawing a line between commerce and everything else that

11   is not commerce is drawing an artificial line, drawing a

12   line between Congress and manufacturing?

13               MR. CARVIN:        The words "inactivity" and

14   "activity" are not in the Constitution.                     The words

15   "commerce" and "noncommerce" are.                     And again, it's a

16   distinction that comes, Justice Kagan, directly from the

17   text of the Constitution.

18               The Framers consciously gave Congress the

19   ability to regulate commerce, because that's not a

20   particularly threatening activity that deprives you of

21   individual freedom.    If you were required, if you were

22   authorized to require A to transfer property to B, you

23   have, as the early cases put it, a monster in

24   legislation which is against all reason in justice,

25   because everyone intuitively understands that regulating

                                    106

 1   people who voluntarily enter into contracts in setting

 2   changing conditions does not create the possibility of

 3   Congress compelling wealth transfers among the

 4   citizenry.    And that is precisely why the Framers denied

 5   them the power to compel commerce, and precisely why

 6   they didn't give them plenary power.

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Thank you,

 8   Mr. Carvin.

 9                 General Verrilli, you have four minutes

10   remaining.

11         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

12                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

13                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              Thank you, Mr. Chief

14   Justice.

15                 Congress confronted a grave problem when it

16   enacted the Affordable Care Act.                   The 40 million

17   Americans who can't get health insurance and suffered

18   often very terrible consequences.                       Now, we agree, I

19   think -- everyone arguing this case agrees that Congress

20   could remedy that problem by imposing the insurance

21   requirement at the point of sale.

22                 That won't work.             The reason it won't work

23   is because people will still show up at the hospital or

24   at their physician's office seeking care without

25   insurance, causing the cost shifting problem.                         And

                                      107

 1   Mr. Clement's suggestion that they can be signed up for

 2   a high risk pool at that point is utterly unrealistic.

 3                 Think about how much it would cost to get

 4   the insurance when you are at the hospital or at the

 5   doctor.   It would be -- it would be unfathomably high,

 6   that will never work.        Congress understood that.          It

 7   chose a means that will work.                The means that it saw

 8   work in the States and in the State of Massachusetts and

 9   that, and that it had every reason to think would work

10   on a national basis.

11                 That is the kind of choice of means that

12   McCulloch says that the Constitution leaves to the

13   democratically accountable branches of government.

14   There is no temporal limitation in the Commerce Clause.

15   Everyone subject to this regulation is in or will be in

16   the health care market.          They are just being regulated

17   in advance.    That's exactly the kind of thing that ought

18   to be left to the judgment of Congress and the

19   democratically accountable branches of government.

20                 And I think this is actually a paradigm

21   example of the kind of situation that Chief Justice

22   Marshall envisioned in McCulloch itself, that the

23   provisions of the Constitution needed to be interpreted

24   in a manner that would allow them to be effective in

25   addressing the great crises of human affairs that the

                                      108

 1   Framers could not even envision.

 2               But if there is any doubt about that under

 3   the Commerce Clause, then I urge this Court to uphold

 4   the minimum coverage provision as an exercise of the

 5   taxing power.

 6               Under New York v. United States, this is

 7   precisely a parallel situation.                If the Court thinks

 8   there is any doubt about the ability of Congress to

 9   impose the requirement in 5000A(a), it can be treated as

10   simply the predicate to which the tax incentive of

11   5000A(b) seeks accomplishment.               And the Court -- as the

12   Court said in New York, has a solemn obligation to

13   respect the judgments of the democratically accountable

14   branches of government, and because this statute can be

15   construed in a manner that allows it to be upheld in

16   that way, I respectfully submit that it is this Court's

17   duty to do so.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, General.

19               Counsel, we'll see you tomorrow.

20               (Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in the

21   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
